## üîß Technical Implementation

### Memory Intelligence Service
The core service (`MemoryIntelligenceService`) provides:

1. **Enhanced Relevance Calculation**
   - Semantic similarity using vector embeddings
   - Recency scoring (decay over time)
   - Topic alignment with current query
   - Context continuity analysis

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Topic frequency tracking
   - Conversation threading
   - Engagement pattern recognition
   - Trend identification

3. **Intelligent Summarization**
   - LLM-powered conversation summaries
   - Key entity extraction
   - Action item identification
   - Sentiment analysis

### Integration with Agent Service
The enhanced memory system integrates seamlessly with the existing agent:

```python
# Enhanced memory context retrieval
intelligent_context = await memory_intelligence_service.get_intelligent_memory_context(
    query=request.message,
    user_id=request.user_id,
    max_memories=5,
    include_insights=True
)

# Build enhanced memory context
enhanced_memory_context = self._build_intelligent_memory_context(
    relevant_memories, memory_insights, context_summary
)
```

## üìä Relevance Scoring Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm:

```
Total Score = (
    semantic_similarity √ó 0.4 +
    recency_score √ó 0.15 +
    frequency_score √ó 0.1 +
    topic_alignment √ó 0.2 +
    context_continuity √ó 0.15
)
```

### Scoring Factors:

1. **Semantic Similarity** (40%): Vector similarity between query and memory
2. **Recency Score** (15%): How recently the memory was created (30-day decay)
3. **Frequency Score** (10%): How often the topic appears in conversations
4. **Topic Alignment** (20%): Overlap between farming topics in query and memory
5. **Context Continuity** (15%): Relationship to current conversation thread

## üéØ Memory Classification

Memories are automatically classified into types:

- **`question`**: User questions and inquiries
- **`problem_solving`**: Issues and troubleshooting discussions
- **`positive_feedback`**: Thanks and positive responses
- **`market_inquiry`**: Pricing and market-related queries
- **`farming_activity`**: Specific farming tasks and activities
- **`general_conversation`**: General farming discussions

## üîç Entity Extraction

The system extracts key farming entities:

### Coffee Varieties
- SL28, SL34, Ruiru 11, Batian, K7

### Locations
- Kenyan counties (Nyeri, Kiambu, Muranga, etc.)

### Time References
- Today, yesterday, week, month, season, harvest time

### Farming Context
- Crop mentions
- Activity types (planting, harvesting, pruning)
- Problem indicators
- Season references

## üß™ Testing

Run the memory intelligence test suite:

```bash
python test_memory_intelligence.py
```

This will test:
- Memory context retrieval
- Relevance scoring
- Insight extraction

    "semantic_similarity": 0.4,
    "recency_score": 0.15,
    "topic_alignment": 0.2,
    # ...
}

# Memory insights settings
INSIGHTS_MIN_FREQUENCY = 2
INSIGHTS_MAX_RESULTS = 5
INSIGHTS_ANALYSIS_DAYS = 30
```
