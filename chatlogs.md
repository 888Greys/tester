This insect is destroying coffee bushes it bores just above the ground or a few inches below the soil and eats the pith. It's hard to remove mechanically with a wire as it moves up the stem neither can you inject insecticide as it's up the stem. It's common in areas with a lot of Mulch. Pls advice.

Here are detailed control measures for managing grub larvae pests in coffee plants, specifically focusing on the Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei):

1. Cultural Control
Sanitation: Regularly remove and destroy infested berries from the plants and the ground. This helps reduce the pest population by eliminating breeding sites1.

Pruning: Prune coffee plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can make the environment less favorable for the pests2.

Shade Management: Properly manage shade trees to create an unfavorable environment for the Coffee Berry Borer3.

2. Biological Control
Natural Predators: Encourage or introduce natural predators such as ants and parasitic wasps (e.g., Phymastichus coffea) that can help control the Coffee Berry Borer population1.

Fungal Pathogens: Use entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana, which can infect and kill the larvae and adult beetles2.

3. Chemical Control
Insecticides: Apply insecticides specifically labeled for use against coffee pests. It‚Äôs crucial to follow the recommended guidelines to minimize environmental impact and prevent resistance 
development3.

Traps: Use pheromone traps to monitor and reduce adult beetle populations. These traps can help in early detection and management of the pest4.

4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Combination of Methods: Implement a coordinated approach that combines cultural, biological, and chemical control methods. This holistic strategy helps manage the pest population effectively while minimizing harm to the environment and non-target organisms4.

5. Monitoring and Early Detection
Regular Inspections: Conduct regular inspections of coffee plants to detect early signs of infestation. Early detection allows for timely intervention and reduces the spread of the pest1.

Pheromone Traps: Use pheromone traps to monitor the presence and activity of adult beetles. This helps in assessing the infestation level and planning control measures accordingly2.

6. Farmer Education and Training
Awareness Programs: Educate farmers about the importance of pest management practices and how to implement them effectively. Training programs can help farmers identify pests early and apply control measures correctly3.

The main challenge with most coffee farmers in the World is the ignorance of proper timing (the 'WHEN ") for the important agronomic practices.

Here are the major practices to do in your coffee farm this month:

 *MAJOR AGRONOMIC PRACTICES(BAPs) FOR OCTOBER 2024 IN COFFEE.* 

 *_Nutrition and Harvesting_* 

Farming is interesting and good yields are as a result of proper timing (the 'WHEN ') of application.Most farmers do forget or are not prepared or don't know when to apply what at what time.
Below is just a summary of the Do's to do in your coffee farm this month.

 *1.Nutrition* 
In our day to day life,we as human beings feed in a variety of foods as ugali,matoke,meat,greens  etc.Its boring taking one same meal over the weeks.I could rephrase this,how would you feel if you took githeri for a whole month?Will you like it?I don't think you may like it.
Just like we human beings,coffee requires a balanced fertiliser program for better yields and quality.

A balanced fertiliser program is as a result of soil test and analysis.It involves a combination of  products such as  NPK fertiliser,manure,lime application, foliar feeds such as that of Zinc and boron. 

Two weeks after the short rains of October/November its important applying NPK fertiliser and manure/organic fertilizer. Manure application is vital as it ensures good soil structure,good moisture and nutrients retention.
Apply 10L of manure or 250g-500g of organic fertilizer. 

NPK fertiliser-use at the recommended rates

 *2.Keeping records* 
It's very vital to keep record on labour costs,harvest.A record will guide on how much profit/loss we could be naking.

 *3.Desuckering* 
Remove all unwanted suckers before feeding your coffee.Otherwise,these will be alternate sinks for the nutrients.

4 *.Weeding* 
Weeds reduces the yields by half.Ensure you uproot under canopy,Slash between rows.
Herbicides usage may affect the quality of final bean as residues.Thus avoid them.

 *5.Harvesting* 
In most parts coffee has started ripening. It's important that as we pick,put in clean bucket and sacks,ensure the coffee does not get into contact with soil.Don't pick the overripe,or green berries.

 *Note:* 
‚óèUse of pesticides and fungicides at this stage would leave residues of chemicals in the final bean.Avoid these.Use other Integrated methods to control the pests and diseases.
‚óèIt's important you apply both fertilizer and manure in your farm two weeks after the rains.
‚óèUse of compost or manure regularly on your trees helps cut the rate of application and hence cost of NPK. 
‚óèAs a farmer, you will get the highest yields in an environmentally sustainable way if you use both composted manure, man-made fertilisers  as NPK ,foliars and lime.

18/10/2024, 23:26 - +254 795 220161: SALVAGING COFFEE FARMS FROM EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE 2024   & IN THE FUTURE.

Preventing coffee trees from drying up.(An effect of climate change)

The beauty of coffee farming is seeing the results-healthy ,vigorous-growing trees.

One year ago,a time like now ,I put down in an article with similar topic as this on how to adapt coffee farms to climate change.It mentioned that,at no instance can we stop climate from changing but we can adapt to it.(https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dennis-kinyua-938628266_coffee-climatechange-environmentalsustainability-activity-7114680768315990017-nrgT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android).

Having visited about 42 coffee farmers in the course of the month.Having seeing posts  of farmers seeking advice on what to do with their drying coffee;pushes me to enlighten us on how to shun from this calamity.
This month we are always enjoying the short rains,applying fertiliser in our farms,our coffee ripening;but the opposite is happening with coffee trees drying up,no fatigation etc.The rain has delayed.

Below are BAPs you can use to adapt your coffee.:
1.Due to increase in temperatures
2.Due to increased rainfall.


 *How to adapt coffee farms to extreme dry conditions* . 

1.Manure/Organic fertiliser application 
These increase soil organic matter which facilitates retention of moisture in the soil.Apply during whrn soil is wet.
2.Mulching -Reduces evaporation rate thus much moisture is retained. 
3.Shade trees-Reduces evapotranspiration, thus increasing soil moisture.Also, leafs fall increases soil organic matter.
4.Irrigation
There is no harm in irrigating your coffee trees especially in extreme dry conditions. Will you watch out and wait for the coffee trees and berries to dry up?Don't question.
Just irrigate and safe the crop.Do drip irrigation.

 *How to adapt coffee farms to extreme rainy conditions* . 

1.Mulching-Reduces speed of surface run off and allows for easier infiltration.
2.Shade trees -Reduces the intensity of rain drops and their roots bind soil together.
3.Plant stabilising grasses on the edge of terraces.
4.Terracing on hill side.

25/10/2024, 17:35 - +254 726 655924: I thought biovitam folia is a folier feed or fartilizer

25/10/2024, 17:46 - +254 722 721900: Why can't they subject their product to scrutiny  as expected.  There is a well laid out procedure. Why use shortcuts . Or what am I  not understanding

25/10/2024, 18:35 - +254 723 247345: We have been treated to a circus of a foliar fertiliser that can control CBD. Agronomist, can you attest to that, or is it a marketing strategy.

The statement on diseases/pests is misleading and false because that product has not been tested for that function. It doesnt matter how many demonstrations they do, if the product has not been registered as a pesticide it should not be marketed as a pesticide. Why are we entertaining this?
26/10/2024, 08:44 - +254 729 338971: If the company wants to sell the product for management of diseases/pests they should submit it for evaluation and registration. If the product works as they claim, then they shouldnt have a problem doing this. <This message was edited>

03/11/2024, 15:27 - +254 795 220161: *MAJOR BEST AGRONOMIC PRACTICES IN COFFEE  FOR NOVEMBER 2024.*

With the effects of climate change, the farmers have been waiting for the rains to apply manure manure and fertiliser in our farms. Its my hope that you as a coffee farmer have purchased manure enough for your trees and also fertiliser.

It's important we be aware that,feeding contributes the highest percentage of tonnes you get from your coffee farm.The size and quality of cherry too will be a determinant of what you feed the soil with.

The rains have began and its important we now fo this 2weeks after the rains fall down well(when the soil is moist and feeder roots are actively growing).

Also in some parts  the coffee has flowered hence the below practices will help.

The major agronomic practices for November 2024 includes:

1. Manure application-Manure should be well decomposed . Whether farmyard or compost.
This aids in water and nutrients retention by the soil.Put a debe/ half a debe per tree.

2. Fertilizer application.Its important you feed the coffee plant depending on the amount of coffee it holds.An NPK fertiliser is best for coffee.

3. Berry borer trap installation in the farm. 
In the warm regions Coffee Berry Borer tends to get into the ripe cherries.Thus as the coffee continues to ripen,have Berry Borer traps in your farm.

4. Weeding and mulching 
Weeding is important to reduce the risks of competition for nutrients with the coffee plant.Ensure no weeds under canopy.
After manure and fertiliser application ,mulch your coffee to facilitate moisture retention.

5.Foliar feeds -
Spray foliars high in zinc and Boron  for the coffee where pinheads have been formed. 
For pesticide spray,be cautious of the PHI. 

6. Composting -Its very important that you continue making compost heaps to use in your farms next year.
Use coffee pulp to make compost too.

 *7.Record keeping* 
It's very important to keep the records of yields per harvest,labour and transport costs.
Also record the type of fertiliser and amount applied per tree.

 *NOTE* :
‚óè Nutrition is very important in coffee farms.
‚óèKeeping records is a vital tool in the agribusiness of coffee.
‚óèA good parent will not deny her children food so is a coffee farmer to their coffee trees.

05/11/2024, 23:30 - +254 701 641933: Zinc and boron done in January and February for April flowers and July , august for October flowers
05/11/2024, 23:34 - +254 795 220161: Zinc and Boron are vital in and during berry expansion. 

Manure should be applied either in September/October/November (on short rains) *when the soil is moist.* 
There has been no rains in most parts and rains are here with us. Hence the recommendation.
05/11/2024, 23:50 - +254 701 641933: Manure application

Apply 1 - 2 debes of well-decomposed manure/coffee pulp once a year during the dry weather, a month before the rains
Dig a shallow furrow ring (4 ‚Äì 6‚Äù deep), 30cm wide, starting from the drip line towards the stem. Apply the manure and mix with soil
05/11/2024, 23:53 - +254 701 641933: Boron/Zinc application

Apply a foliar mixture of Zinc and Boron at the rate of 2 - 3kg of each per Ha (40 - 60 g of each/20 liters of water) 2 ‚Äì 3 months before the main flowering
05/11/2024, 23:53 - +254 701 641933: Zinc (Zn)                                        

It is the only known metallic plant hormone which: 

Boosts flower initiation and formation
Enhances fruit set and leaf size

Coffee production is greatly threatened in the coming year,especially west of rift because of severe attack of leaf rust. As a result,most farms have experienced a serious dieback of primaries given that proper nutrition of the trees is a challenge.
I don‚Äôt know if the central and east of rift has experienced this or not.  AFA and KALRO should issue an alert and remedial responses to safeguard our coffee market. Actually it is an ‚ÄºÔ∏è

19/11/2024, 10:05 - +254 722 776402: Good morning team, those having challenges on leaf rust can remedy the situation by applying Cafedak @ 50mls/20L on monthly basis. 
Cafedak is a foliar fertilizer from Highchem Agriculture Ltd. It gives the coffee trees an ability to build internal defense mechanism to fight the leaf rust disease.

19/11/2024, 13:21 - +254 722 844789: It's also an opportunity to see if readily available organic remedies can solve or at least manage the challenge.
The use of wood vinegar/liquid smoke, neem oil and seed cake has been proven to be just as beneficial as artificial chemical solutions at a more affordable cost.

20/11/2024, 00:29 - +254 795 220161: *Coffee Farming Agribusiness: Key Determinants of Yield and Berry Quality.* 

When it comes to coffee farming, the factors that influence yields per tree and the quality of coffee berries are numerous. However, it's crucial to understand which factors have the most significant impact. Here's an in-depth look at what truly determines the performance of a coffee farm:
1. *Age of the Coffee Trees* 
The age of the coffee tree plays a pivotal role in both the quantity and quality of the harvest. Younger coffee trees (typically under 5 years) are more productive, producing more berries compared to older trees. This is similar to the analogy of young cows being more productive milkers. As trees age, their primary branches become less fruitful, and flowering occurs mostly at the edges of these branches, resulting in lower yields.
Rejuvenation: This process, which involves cutting back older trees to stimulate the growth of new, young stems, is essential for maintaining high productivity. *While it may seem counterintuitive and painful to cut back mature trees, rejuvenation leads to significantly higher yields in the long run, often starting to show results in two years.* This rejuvenation process is best done every 5-6 years by cutting a portion of the farm (1/3 or 1/4) to allow for the growth of younger, more productive stems.
2. *Pruning for Productivity* .
 Pruning is vital for increasing yields by enhancing the tree‚Äôs ability to flower. Flowering is a critical phase for coffee trees, and its success is determined by two factors: sufficient sunlight and water (rain). Proper pruning ensures that the coffee tree has a structure that allows sunlight to penetrate deeper into the branches and encourages robust flowering. *The better the pruning, the more flowers and, consequently, more berries the tree will produce.* 
Other factors include:
3. Nutrient Management and Soil Health
Healthy, well-nourished soil supports the growth of the coffee tree and improves its resistance to pests and diseases.
4. Pest and Disease Control
Maintaining good pest and disease management practices is critical for ensuring the health of the coffee trees. IPDM practices, including the use of biological control agents, organic pesticides, and regular monitoring, can help maintain a healthy coffee farm and prevent infestations.
5. Environmental Factors
Coffee trees thrive in specific climatic conditions, including consistent rainfall, moderate temperatures, and altitude. Any significant shifts in weather patterns, such as prolonged droughts or excessive rainfall, can negatively impact both the yields and the quality of the coffee.

In conclusion, *the highest determining factors for both coffee yields and berry quality are rejuvenation and pruning.* These practices ensure that coffee trees remain productive and capable of flowering properly. While soil health, pest and disease management, and climate are important, they are secondary to the structural maintenance of the trees. Understanding the life cycle of the coffee tree and the importance of rejuvenation can lead to sustainable, higher-quality yields, ultimately boosting a farmer's agribusiness.

24/11/2024, 23:49 - +254 795 220161: OVERCOMING THE DREADFUL EFFECTS OF COFFEE LEAF RUST (CLR) IN THE UPCOMING AND FUTURE SEASONS.

One of the most destructive diseases affecting coffee is Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR), caused by Hemileia vastatrix.This disease reduces coffee yield and quality, with climate change and poor management practices exacerbating its spread.The SL variety, in particular, has faced severe losses due to CLR. This article discusses methods to manage CLR and ensure a sustainable future for coffee farming.

CLR is a fungal disease that affects coffee plant leaves, reducing photosynthesis and leading to lower yields. It is characterized by orange spots on the upper leaf surface and yellow powder on the underside. The disease thrives in humid, moist conditions, spreading via water droplets. While SL and K7 varieties are highly susceptible, resistant varieties like Ruiru 11 and partially resistant Batian are more resilient.


The SL variety has been severely impacted by CLR. This disease leads to significant crop loss,forcing farmers to invest in costly fungicides and control measures.This year(2024) CLR has affected most farms with Sl in Kenya.

CLR can be managed through several practices:

1.Avoid Overhead Irrigation and Overspraying: Since CLR thrives in moist conditions, reducing moisture on the leaves is essential.

2. Proper Pruning for Air Circulation: moisture dry faster thus reducing the chance of infection.

3.Rejuvenation:By cutting back old,weak stems promotes healthy,disease-resistant growth.

4.Proper Nutrition: Fertilizing coffee plants with the right nutrients helps strengthen the plant's natural defenses against CLR.

5. Planting or Grafting with Resistant Varieties:The most effective long-term solution is planting resistant varieties like Ruiru 11 or grafting resistant varieties onto susceptible rootstocks.

6. Use of Curative and Preventive Chemicals: Fungicides like Klassic, rustblast  and Twiga Hypox can manage CLR if applied at the right time. Curative fungicides should be used when about 10% of the leaves show symptoms.Copper fungicides are preventive.


The impact of CLR on SL and other susceptible varieties is significant but manageable.By adopting good agricultural practices, such as proper irrigation, pruning, nutrition, and the use of fungicides, farmers can reduce the disease's impact. However, the most effective long-term solution is the adoption of resistant varieties like Ruiru 11 or the grafting of susceptible varieties.

Although transitioning to resistant varieties may involve upfront costs, the long-term benefits in terms of yield and disease management far outweigh the challenges Embracing these resilient practices is essential to ensuring the sustainability of coffee farming in a changing climate.

25/11/2024, 07:52 - +254 795 220161: Goodmorning sir,
No.
The only thing have looked at is the cultural methods.
It's important also to keep the land weed free because some weeds such as oxalis are an alternative host for the disease.

26/11/2024, 15:22 - +254 735 819129: I believe you are not being realistic as a farmer. I fast planted my coffee bush in 2010 en it wash Batian.  I later planted another one in 2019. I come from Bungoma county. Coz of some replacement,I happened to cap the farm with ruiru 11 and K7. At the same time, my neighbor has K7. My nearest coffee research centre is namwela coffee research. Among all these varieties to CLR, Batian is the weakest followed by k7 then ruiru 11. Believe me not, to CBD K7 is more susceptible then followed by ruiru 11. For all this long I have never had any problem of CBD with Batian. To most of mineral deficiencies, Batian is most exposed. Keep in mind that other parables constant. For Batian that was first established in cri namwela was uprooted and re- established coz of irreversible infestation of CLR. In general, with good controlof CLR in Batian, this bush shall do wonders in coffee production in Kenya
26/11/2024, 15:28 - +254 722 721900: Was just reporting my experience.  I have occasional mild BBC attacks but have never experienced CLR or CBD in Batian. Ukweli.
26/11/2024, 15:43 - +254 735 819129: I need to get from you the secret of how you have been managing the control of CLR in Batian. What is this secret please! For observation of regional coffee calendars, don't mind about it. What is it? What have you been doing?
26/11/2024, 16:17 - +254 722 721900: Nothing.  Just that I haven't had it. I will ask other farmers from my region
26/11/2024, 16:20 - +254 727 313906: How often do you spray copper?
26/11/2024, 16:51 - +254 735 819129: Which copper? Green or red. For any,I always take them as preventives where I frequently use green
26/11/2024, 16:55 - +254 727 313906: I always spray green copper four times a year and I haven't had a problem with CLR or CBD.
26/11/2024, 16:56 - +254 735 819129: Which coffee variety is that?
26/11/2024, 16:57 - +254 727 313906: Batian. I also do the same for Ruiru grafted.
26/11/2024, 16:58 - +254 722 721900: üëç
26/11/2024, 17:03 - +254 735 819129: For Batian, I went as far as using alto and especially during over bearing but still yet to go through. With some knowledge acquired from this wall,am being optimistic 2024/2025. Maybe things will work but for sure like ECF for Friesians so it is CLR for Batian
26/11/2024, 17:13 - +254 735 819129: You are lucky if you can break through Batian with only 4 times green copper a year. 2023/2024 season was my worst hit season with CLR tho had pemper harvest. This forced me to seek CRI literature for Batian but still am yet to be convinced that Batian is a CLR resistant variety
26/11/2024, 17:42 - +254 727 313906: The other thing is to spray foliar once each month or twice when the bush is heavily laden with berries. That way I was able to overcome die back which is also rampant in batian.

*Heavenly Father, we come before You today to lift up our coffee farmers. Bless their hands as they toil in the fields, nurturing the plants from tender seedlings to fruitful harvests.
Grant them wisdom and strength to make wise decisions, and protect them from harm as they work. May their labor be rewarded with bountiful yields and fair prices.
Guide them to cultivate sustainable practices, preserving the environment for future generations. May their hearts be filled with gratitude for the opportunity to provide for their families and communities.
In Your name, we pray. Amen.*

1: is it ok to combine tabibu,acetak and borozinc in one knapsack of 20 litres while spraying??
2: we have already been informed that leaf rust spreads during rainy and manifest in dry season,why treat in dry season and prevent during rain season and not vis Versa like in January & February and march _may as indicated in your program?
3: what is the active ingredient in Bugatti as compared to tabibu?

30/12/2024, 21:44 - +254 720 464900: It is not very clear, what is miscible and which are not. You understand where the farmers are coming from, labour is not cheap. How can we reduce the no. of repeat sprays. From the farmers query, there are three different elements fungicide, pesticide and the fertilizers. If you  are to do them separately, it means spraying three times. How can this be reduced to one or at least two? <This message was edited>

31/12/2024, 10:40 - +254 701 641933: You will save labour but achieve nothing so better to spray separately and achieve the target again there is season for each spray eg fungicide is during rainy or wet weather so folier are not necessary as zinc and boron are done on hot months like January and February June July august
31/12/2024, 10:45 - +254 701 641933: Sir when you do right spray program no chemicals will be sprayed at once

Not only in coffee but
Soil is life. It is the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems and the silent force behind the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. Yet, too often, it is overlooked, abused, and left to deteriorate. One of the most critical, yet simple, principles in regenerative agriculture is this: Never let the soil dry.

The Science of Moisture and Soil Health

Healthy soil is more than dirt‚Äîit is a living ecosystem teeming with microorganisms, fungi, and organic matter that work in harmony to sustain plant life. Soil moisture is the lifeblood of this system, acting as a conduit for nutrients, enabling microbial activity, and maintaining soil structure. When soil dries out, this balance collapses:

Microbial death: Beneficial microorganisms die or go dormant without adequate moisture, disrupting nutrient cycling.

Soil compaction: Dry soil hardens and loses its porosity, making it difficult for roots to penetrate and reducing water infiltration when it does rain.

Erosion: Dry, exposed soil is vulnerable to wind and water erosion, stripping away the organic matter that took years to accumulate.

Regenerative Practices to Keep the Soil Moist

In regenerative agriculture, we seek to mimic natural systems, which rarely leave soil exposed or dry. Here are the key strategies to maintain soil moisture:

1. Mulching

A thick layer of mulch‚Äîmade from straw, leaves, wood chips, or crop residues‚Äîacts as a protective blanket over the soil. Mulch:

Reduces evaporation by shielding the soil from direct sunlight.

Prevents rain from compacting the soil surface.

Slowly decomposes, adding organic matter to the soil.

2. Cover Crops

Nature abhors bare soil. Cover crops such as legumes, grasses, or clover provide a living cover that keeps the soil cool and shaded, preventing moisture loss. Their roots:

Improve water infiltration.

Stabilize the soil structure.

Enhance the water-holding capacity of the soil.

3. Minimal Tillage

Tilling the soil disrupts its structure, breaks up fungal networks, and exposes moisture to evaporation. By minimizing tillage, we preserve the soil's natural water-retention capabilities and protect the microbial life that thrives in undisturbed soil.

4. Organic Matter

Soil rich in organic matter acts like a sponge, holding water during dry spells and releasing it slowly to plant roots. Composting and using animal manure are powerful ways to boost organic matter content.

5. Agroforestry and Shade Crops

Trees and shrubs planted alongside crops provide shade, reducing soil temperature and evaporation. Their deep roots also draw water from deeper layers of the soil, helping to stabilize moisture levels.

The Role of Soil Moisture in Climate Resilience

With unpredictable weather patterns and prolonged droughts becoming more frequent, keeping soil moist is no longer optional‚Äîit is essential for survival. Moist soils are better equipped to absorb heavy rains, reducing flooding, and to endure dry spells, ensuring crops survive and thrive.

Moreover, moist soil acts as a carbon sink, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it into organic matter. This makes it a powerful ally in the fight against climate change.

A Call to Action

"Never let the soil dry" is not just a farming technique; it is a philosophy that acknowledges the interdependence of water, soil, and life. It calls us to steward the land with care, ensuring that future generations inherit soil that is rich, fertile, and alive.

If you are a small-scale farmer, a gardener, or simply a lover of the earth, let this principle guide you. Protect your soil. Cover it, nurture it, and never let it dry.

02/01/2025, 08:35 - +254 722 442781: Some information here isn't as accurate as presented .
1. Cover crops do not conserve moisture . Water in the soil is lost through 3 means .
(a) evaporation.  Through the soil surface. 
(b) uptake by plants through transpiration.    This contributes to the highest loss of moisture in the soil, and it is erroneous to assume that cover crops help in retaining moisture.  Cover crops compete for moisture with the main crop and are like weeds .
(c) infiltration below the root zone .

Shade trees /Agro forestry.  I would like farmers to assess for themselves and see whether there are differences in performance between shaded and unshaded crops. 
Shading reduces photosynthesis, and no crop can produce optimally under shade. A shaded  coffee tree may look healthy but will always produce less than the unshaded one.

02/01/2025, 12:13 - +254 735 819129: Critically and scientifically look at this statement "never let the soil dry". This man is very accurate. Cover crops conserve moisture. Allow me give you a simple illustration. Measure  2 small fields of 2m squared next to one another. Make sure that no shade is not next to them. Plant potato vines in one of them and leave the other unplanted. Expose both fields to equal weather conditions for a while. Test for moisture content of both fields and write back to this context. Similarly,carry out this experiment to shaded and unshaded soils. Secondly, water absorbed from the soil by the plant is used by the plant in a process called anabolism before transpiration. It doesn't run through like water in a pipeline <This message was edited>
02/01/2025, 12:39 - +254 722 442781: It is not a trial that I am going to do , I have done it on several occasions.  But logic thinking alone will inform you the following. 
1. Bare land without  a cover crop may lose water in only two ways .
(a) evaporation.  Which is the loss of water at the surface of the soil . Once the water evaporates at the surface,  the water molecules below the surface move up through capillary action and then evaporate .
2. Water infiltrating below the root zone .

Alternatively, on a ground that has crops , the loss is on 3 ways . The two mentioned above and through transpiration and finally evaporation at the leaf surface. 
Water lost by plants by the process of evapotranspiration is much more than evaporation because it is taken below the surface. A plant behaves like a pipe inserted on the ground and the difference is that water emitted at the surface is inform of tiny microscopic droplets. 

A ha  of cabbages may emit to the atmosphere 60 cubic meter of water and remain dry in the 3rd day while a similar Ha with 1 week cabbage crop may go for a week plus before requiring more water .
02/01/2025, 12:41 - +254 722 442781: Why do you think a younger crop require less water than a mature crop ? It's due to bigger canopy .
Any cover crop with leaves covering the ground acts like small tubelets tapping water from the soil .
02/01/2025, 12:46 - +254 722 442781: "Never let the soil dry " is a good statement, but how practical is it, especially during dry spells ? 
Supposing no rains fall between Jan and the end of March , how would one without irrigation stop the soil from drying up ?
02/01/2025, 12:56 - +254 722 338131: *Mulching* is always a good bet but requires a serious commitment for sourcing like planting vetiver rows in the coffee plantation to be  sustainable all year round.
02/01/2025, 13:00 - +254 722 442781: Thick Mulching and   creating a basin around coffee trees are two main methods of moisture conservation. 
Cover crop is a moisture drainer but good for soil conservation..
02/01/2025, 13:04 - +254 735 819129: The main issue here is not letting the soil to dry. This is subject. Can we agree to a certain level that cover crop prevent the rate of soil drying?  So do shade or not? This is what the guy was trying to put across.
02/01/2025, 13:12 - +254 722 442781: Cover crops CANNOT conserve moisture.  Shade crops whose roots are far away from coffee or other plants may conserve moisture but will affect photosynthesis.  

Just do a simple experiment. 
Get two jugs and fill them with water . Leave one open and the other one insert some succulent growing plants or flowers and monitor the water levels for a week ..
02/01/2025, 13:26 - +254 735 819129: You are mixing me up. You agree that evaporation causes loss of water in the soil. Then how can a cover crop not control evaporation? Your experiment of 2 jugs of water doesn't match with this subject. Here ,we already dealing water in the soil not rain water or any other source. I mean water mixed with the soil not freed water no!
02/01/2025, 13:53 - +254 722 442781: üòä what is evaporating, my friend? Water, not the soil .
Let me give you a practical example.  

1 ha of coffee seedlings on a normal day may get an irrigation of 1.5mm in 5 days ,while a full-grown coffee will take 5mm .
Why ? 
The bigger the leaf surface area and deeper root system, the higher the water uptake . 

If you apply 5mm of water on two surfaces measuring 10m¬≤ ,one  mulched and the other one  un mulched and exposed them to sunshine  for a period of time , the unmulched ground will lose more water .  
The reason is that the mulch material will keep the ground cooler and, therefore, less evaporation..

If the two fields are left bare , they will lose water at the same rate .

If you ask someone to turn the soil in one  field , it will lose more water than the un disturbed field .

If you plant potatoes as you had suggested earlier ,  the planted field will lose more water than the bare field . And the bigger the potatoes cover on the ground or rather the bigger the potatoes, leaf surface area, the higher the loss . 

If you take time to study irrigation, hii conversion itaisha but am not surprised because it took me time to understand the concept.
02/01/2025, 14:03 - +254 726 790922: Senior, you are truly called to this field, you are a gem and I celebrate you today and always.

02/01/2025, 14:06 - +254 735 819129: You might not be understanding the subject matter in this context. This guy was very clear in his or her statement " never let the soil to dry" and he/she went a head to discuss how you can avoid letting the soil not to dry. To me he/she covered all aspects through which you can achieve that. You came out to challenge the factors of cover crops and foresting(shade) the soil. To me you are yet to convince me with your points which are experimentally displaced. I believe it will take you years to convince any over the same
02/01/2025, 14:40 - +254 722 442781: If this was not a farmers group where correct information matters  , I would have left this matter to rest . But in this case , good understanding is key .
 When the idea about moisture conservation was posted , I read it , understood it, and I responded with what I didn't agree with.  

I fully understood the message, and I disputed that cover crops can conserve moisture because they can not. 

How is moisture lost in the soil as far as crop production is concerned? 

Through evaporation on the soil surface and through evaporation at the leaf surface.. the bigger the leaf cover on the surface, the higher the loss . 

Evaporation from the soil is a process where the top layer, eg 1st one inch  of the soil, loses water to the atmosphere,  water from the second layer 2"  moves up to replace the lost water through capillarity . Tuko pamoja mpaka hapo .

Under normal circumstances,  or on bare soil , water movement upwards only happens through capillarity .. Right ? 

On a cropped surface,  water movement upwards happens through 2 methods , via plant roots after absorption and capillarity.   So, cropped surface loses water via two processes.  

Whereas a cropped surface may appear shaded , the water lost through plant leaves is higher than that t of bare ground because the loss is through capillarity and root absorption from as deep as the depth of the plant roots .

Let me take you to irrigation..
 
1 ha of potatoes that is two weeks old will require 20 cubic meters of irrigation per day, while the same  when 10 weeks old  and fully covered, the ground will require 50 m cubic of water per day

Why ? 
It is because of the difference in the leaf  surface area . The higher the leaf surface, the higher the loss of water .

Any growing plant ,whether grass , weeds ,target crop, or cover crop, needs water for it to grow, and therefore, every growing crop contributes to loss of moisture in the soil ..

In order to conserve moisture in soil , use dead materials as mulch.
02/01/2025, 14:55 - +254 735 819129: But in mind that the guy used the term "regenerative agriculture ". Can you please kindly elaborate to what regenerative agriculture mean. This will help me understand you guys better under this matter

02/01/2025, 16:10 - +254 722 442781: One disaster that we find ourselves in , especially the experts, is blind  acceptance of  new concepts as brought to us bila maswali .
Take, for instance, foliar application in coffee . There is a school of thought that thinks that zinc and boron are only required by coffee just before flowering and pinhead stage, while scientifically, the two elements are required throughout the berry formation..
02/01/2025, 16:17 - +254 713 213130: Very true....NB ALL Trace Elements in every foliar apppication are necessary.
02/01/2025, 16:17 - +254 722 442781: Take another example where a farmer is advised to apply C.A.N in April and NPK in October? ü§≠ Potassium ,nitrogen, and phosphorous are required in all growth stages, and ripping is just a single role of potassium, which can not be used as the major role to constrain application only in October ü§≠
02/01/2025, 16:26 - +254 722 442781: We treat nutrients like antagonists that might fight in the soil if applied all in one go ..
02/01/2025, 16:29 - +254 722 593749: Hehehehe üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ... coffee takes all what it needs at certain physiological stages of development and the rest remains in the soil as waste......timely application is paramount.... berry development is based on biological timelines üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
02/01/2025, 16:34 - +254 722 442781: We need to ask ourselves, what are we regerating ? Then build up on that. 
This term was adopted from the natural forests where trees uptake nutrients from the soil to grow .  Produce leaves and seeds that fall on the ground to form humas . Humas is mineralised to form nutrients that are recycled back to the tree . 
This is regeneration. 

But in farming, where you harvest and sell the crop , regeneration would only apply if you return an equivalent of what is sold out as produce ..
02/01/2025, 16:35 - +254 722 442781: Not as waste Jay üòÅ but as a  reserve .
02/01/2025, 16:42 - +254 722 593749: Hehehehe. Only Organic Manure remains as reserve. The rest dissolves and gets absorbed in the soil matrix. Filler material remains just in the soil. That's how soil acidity builds up. For instance....in a 50 kg of C.A.N 26% N....only 13kg is Nitrogen which dissolves and absorbed by roots bases on the Nutritive demand of N.at that particular stage of berry development....a whopping 37kg is filler material that ends up in the soil.
02/01/2025, 16:46 - +254 722 442781: That's true in a bag of C.A.N it's only 13kg that is nitrogen. But when you say a whopping 37kgs is filler materials ,you make it sound like we are putting too much filler materials into the soil üòÖüòÖ
02/01/2025, 16:49 - +254 722 442781: If what you say is true , when soil analysis is conducted ,we would only be seeing zero N ,P,K etc or negatives .
Soil analysis results give indication of available Nutrients as reserves available for crop uptake . Once you get the  results , then you add what is in deficit based on your crop demand.
02/01/2025, 16:49 - +254 722 593749: Hehehhehe. üòÇüòÇüòÇ unfortunately that's true. Someone told me coffee doesn't overfeed it takes from the soil what it requires......
02/01/2025, 16:51 - +254 722 442781: Jay , hapa kwa soil acidity usiongee , it is not brought by over application of fertiliser üòâ
02/01/2025, 16:51 - +254 722 593749: Exactly. Remember soil fertility is the natural inherent ability of soil to supply these Macro n Micro nutrients. Also You may find all of them in adequate amounts in any soil. But where the difference comes is .....are they available for crops uptake????
02/01/2025, 16:52 - +254 722 593749: Okay. What brings about soil acidity in soils?

Nirates, Nitrites & Ammonium are forms in which these ions discharge Hydrogen ions ... So in the past we didn't have high levels of soil acidity... We create imbalance mainly through fertiliser application Sir.
02/01/2025, 17:06 - +254 722 442781: @254722593749 , let's look at this .
Soil acidity in simple terms is the concentration of Hydrogen ions in the soil , right ? 
Let's take a soil depth of 30cm in coffee where we may find 75% of the roots .
What is the volume of this soil in an acre ? 
4000m¬≤ x 0.3m = 1200m¬≥    

Let's look at this from the ground level yaani kwa ground. 
If this was water , how many 10,000 litre tanks would you fill ? 
120 tanks right ? 
Imagine this . 120 ,  10, 000 litre tanks .

Put a 2 bags of C.A.N in 120 tanks ie 100kgs .  = 100/120 = 800g of C.A.N per tank .
Let's assume this was sugar 1kg in 10,000 litre tank would it taste? 
This is how hard it is to affect soil pH using fertiliser üòä

Actually leading cause of Acidity is Rainfall, followed by extraction by crops( lack of use of fertilizer) and improper use of fertilizer is like distance 3rd.

02/01/2025, 17:41 - +254 722 593749: Great. The distant 3 is my concern because this is what farmers have ultimate control over.....lack of judicious application of fertiliser. Farmers need to be trained on using crop estimates to determine the nutritional requirements of whatever crops they're growing. Basically what lewd to high pH values in most soil is low levels of basic elements.... Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium and others....... leading to low pH values hence high levels of acidity.....so let's address what actions by farmers that aggrevate this condition in soils
02/01/2025, 17:43 - +254 722 593749: Cation Exchange Capacity....C.E.C....if Hydrogen becomes the domineering cation when soil is in solution form.......then.....
02/01/2025, 17:46 - +254 722 442781: This is true ! Soil acidification is a complicated  issue that is least understood by many. Its main causes are weathering process /mineralisation,  rainfall, etc .
Fertiliser application, especially DAP and Urea, which have  suffered greatly as contributing to acidification in Kenyan soils, are erroneously blamed . I came to find out later that DAP and urea are the main raw materials for fertlizer blending , and as a result, they must be given a bad name üòÖüòÖüòÖ

02/01/2025, 17:49 - +254 722 442781: Try this next time you conduct soil sampling for analysis.  Sample both cropped and virgin land and compare results .
 We did this in Eldoret, and the pH was the same in both areas .
02/01/2025, 17:50 - +254 722 593749: Okay.
02/01/2025, 17:51 - +254 722 442781: Liming bro . But farmers must be told that ,changing soil PH is a process . 4t of lime may just move the PH by 1 unit only . 
Not all lime is the same .
02/01/2025, 17:53 - +254 722 593749: Correct. Done these alogarithms in a soil chemistry lab and it's quite an involving assignment
02/01/2025, 17:55 - Henry Kinyua: I see intervention at 3 levels : National, regional and farm level .
Determine crop choices even before you go to fertilizer needs. Eg crops like tea thrive well in acidic soils.. so designating high acidic soils as tea zones is one strategy. Then look at liming materials needed is it dusty or granulated lime? What intervention are needed to promote use of each. 
Etc‚Ä¶
The interesting thing is that it is now an area of interest at continental, national and even county level
02/01/2025, 17:55 - +254 722 593749: Very true.
02/01/2025, 18:00 - +254 729 589716: Actually, rainfall dissolves most of soluble minerals and  through leaching , they are taken deep beyond the root zone for the plants to absorb. This leaves soil with insoluble minerals like aluminium oxide or hydroxide which are toxic to plant roots and also fixes available minerals making unavailable to plants
02/01/2025, 18:07 - +254 722 593749: How do we control leaching Sir?
02/01/2025, 18:09 - +254 722 442781: Let's look at the available theories and facts .
1. Soil analysis results give what is available to the plants . 
2. Soil is relatively stable and does not change within less than 2 years and that's why soil analysis is recommended to be done after 2 years .
3. Although high PH restricts availability , what is applied after soil analysis isn't fixed as always assumed.
02/01/2025, 18:12 - +254 722 442781: This process takes years to happen
02/01/2025, 18:13 - +254 729 589716: Ensuring the soil has enough organic matter and mulching into the soil, this will slow down leaching of nutrient into the soil.
02/01/2025, 18:16 - +254 722 593749: I totally concur with You. We're looking at simplified approaches that a typical farmer can explore easily to salvage the situation. Let's also have correct interpretation of the findings of soil analysis so that the farmer can have appropriate correctional measures to usem
02/01/2025, 18:16 - +254 722 442781: True.
02/01/2025, 18:18 - +254 722 442781: Although guys , due to climate change where we must try as much to conserve the rain drop from turning into run off , we cannot run away from leaching .
02/01/2025, 18:19 - +254 722 593749: Absolutely true. Climate Smart Agriculture technologies....water harvesting is one of the approaches. Excavation of RD's and FJ's as well as rehabilitating environmentally sensitive hotspots.....
02/01/2025, 18:30 - +254 729 589716: Infact the major challenge we have due to climate change is rainfall which comes in torrents poorly distributed causing surface runoff soil erosion and leaching of nutrients leaving soil with nothing to support crop growth.
02/01/2025, 18:32 - +254 722 442781: @254722593749 and all the agronomists in the house .
Let's discuss rain drop retention and I will start by sharing my thoughts. 

This is my theory .
Any drop of water that infiltrate into the soil below the root zone must come up not unless it goes too deep .

If the ground is compacted , the top few inches of the soil get saturated and therefore results to run off which is a big loss .
My thinking is that we should retain the rain water within the cropping area . 
How ? 
By creating water basins around coffee trees. 

A basin of 2m by 2m by 0.15m high will hold 600 litres of water which would run off if no basin is moulded .
600 litres x 550 trees of SL in an acre = 330,000 litres of water that can be allowed to inflitrate into the soil .
02/01/2025, 18:33 - +254 722 593749: Good approach.
02/01/2025, 19:09 - +254 725 477877: Which is the recommended spacing for Ruiru 11 coffee varieties
02/01/2025, 20:06 - +254 727 140450: 2 m X 2 m
02/01/2025, 20:37 - +254 722 844789: What about deep and fibrous rooted plants, vetiver grass for maintaining moisture and nutrients where coffee benefits?
02/01/2025, 20:46 - +254 701 641933: Hope basins are 2fts by 2fts by 2fts in between the tree  in coffee farm but to open field is said measurements
02/01/2025, 20:48 - +254 701 641933: This message was deleted
02/01/2025, 20:49 - +254 701 641933: Key strategies to reduce runoff:
Vegetation:
Plant native trees and shrubs with deep roots to absorb more water. 
Establish rain gardens with plants that tolerate temporary flooding. 
Use ground cover plants to protect soil and slow water flow.
02/01/2025, 20:49 - +254 722 442781: It's 1m from the coffee stem on 4 sides ..
02/01/2025, 20:55 - +254 701 641933: Spacing of ruiru 11 is 2 m by 2 m so the canopy takes 2.5 fts to 3fts on two tree is 5-6fts or 2m so it will hinder the management of the crop eg harvesting, fertilizer application, spraying etc so 2fts the skip one line do another line a basin so if you have 100 tree you will dig 50 basin's I will do illustration morning
02/01/2025, 20:56 - +254 722 442781: One can always adjust in closer spacing varieties

02/01/2025, 21:16 - +254 701 641933: Cover crop canopies reduce the impact of raindrops and decrease the breakdown of the soil structure and soil aggregates, which greatly reduces soil erosion and runoff and improves water infiltration.
02/01/2025, 21:30 - +254 722 442781: Depends with the pumping head and form of energy used .
02/01/2025, 21:31 - +254 722 442781: 100% correct.  But they do not conserve moisture üòä
03/01/2025, 07:35 - +254 735 819129: Mr. Ndegwa! My phone is running low battery but back to the subject matter.
Cover crops not conserving soil moisture or conserving. I'm giving you benefit of doubt to both of you. However in reference to my major coffee bushes (batian) you both have a lot to teach me over the same. My research on my reveals that batian doesn't like any underneath growth. For overhead, it must be sparingly and must be shade free to flower. This debate however brings me to a point where I can make the choice of soil moisture conservation best suitable for my bushes. To my coffee neighbors with ruiru 11 have excellent with full shading apart from gruevelia trees
03/01/2025, 07:37 - +254 735 819129: Mr. Ndegwa! There has been questions on Facebook and others on this platform which I'm yet to be fully answered professionally.
Why do you people not rise to the occasion?
03/01/2025, 07:37 - +254 735 819129: Here is another one. About pH. What is the optimum pH for coffee production?
03/01/2025, 07:58 - +254 726 790922: Good morning sir, we are here to test your soil so that you may walk in confidence and ask informed questions. Thank you
03/01/2025, 09:18 - +254 720 750305: 5 to 5.5
03/01/2025, 09:25 - +254 726 790922: With regard to nutrient availability and uptake by crops, the best pH range is 6 to 7
03/01/2025, 10:10 - +254 722 966038: null
03/01/2025, 10:37 - +254 711 269400: Is Batian profitable? In comparison to Ruiru 11 and SLs? 
What would  well managed tree produce per cherry, and it's conversion to clean for a period of 5-6 years before plant conversion?
03/01/2025, 14:27 - +254 735 819129: From Google,CRI give the following information 1: pH range for coffee production -4.5-5.15
Optimum pH for coffee production -4.85-5.10. 
I have read some periodicals which give optimum pH for coffee production as 6 to 6.6.  
Mr . Symo has said 5 to 5.5.  Mr. Olekunyangita now places it at 6 to 7. As a farmer what should I take home as my optimum. Besides this, what's soil analysis in relation to soil pH?
03/01/2025, 14:32 - +254 726 790922: Mkulima, don't overfeed, constipation is real

03/01/2025, 14:44 - +254 726 790922: Kindly allow this to guide you, mine was in relation to nutrient availability to the plant. 

You may want to carry out different soil to ascertain the information, check where the crop is excellent and where the crop is struggling, then we come up with a conclusion
03/01/2025, 14:45 - +254 735 819129: Batian is only 14 years in Kenya. Ruiru 11 about 40 years.  SLs over 60 years. Someone to give a reliable answer for this question must carry out research for the three varieties in all coffee growing ecological zones in Kenya. As from where I sit, this my answer: 
1: batian
2:SLs
3: Ruiru.
03/01/2025, 14:45 - +254 735 819129: Not every food you come across must be eaten
03/01/2025, 14:50 - +254 735 819129: Like I saw the map of Kenya besides this. Where has it disappeared to. Finding it very important going together
03/01/2025, 14:53 - +254 726 790922: This isn't done by the country's institutions, it's a private research sir.
03/01/2025, 15:01 - +254 735 819129: Thanks for this important information. But before we can set out for a conclusion, what is the source of this information or rather what is the reference?
Again, from this forum. Coffee taste is acidic , which pH give the best quality cup?
03/01/2025, 15:36 - +254 720 698206: Average
03/01/2025, 15:48 - +254 720 698206: My experience 
1.sl 28+27, can handle anything so long as they well spaced and pruned to handle leaf rust and CBD, Cooper oxides can handle that.

2.Batian, average production @10kg 2 stem low rainfall will mess you.

3.Small berries, leave it to professional agronomist and large scale estates ie, their have irrigation and no shortage of funds to do whatever they wish to do.

My experience and opinion.
03/01/2025, 16:12 - +254 726 862656: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 17:15 - +254 735 819129: Between batian and SLs am yet to exactly ascertain the difference in terms of characteristics. Maybe the CRI researchers can come out and shed more light about this. For me, both varieties are equally tolerant to short rainfall. They are equally susceptible to CLR. Cherry bean size is equally alike. What brings in minor differences is that SLs are fairly resistant to overbearing, tolerant to TE deficiencies and diebacks. However, SLs are more susceptible to CBD than Batian. In short,I see batian as complicated bush but best tho a very heavy feeder

03/01/2025, 18:11 - +254 727 863638: Sir, this is very encouraging.  Batian is good.  However does capping affect productivity?
03/01/2025, 18:15 - +254 728 831490: sometimes  when  you cap you reduce  the bearing  primaries  and also  you need to do  handling  more times so it's  better  to allow  free growth  but change  cycle  after  every  5 major crops
03/01/2025, 18:16 - +254 728 831490: For  SL farmers  remember  cost of production is high  because  of controlling CBD and Leaf Lust
03/01/2025, 18:16 - +254 727 863638: Thank you! Does 5 major crops in any way relate to five years?
03/01/2025, 18:17 - +254 728 831490: Yes but remember  you start  counting  3rd year from plating
03/01/2025, 18:18 - +254 728 831490: Third year from planting  you count as first  major  crop
03/01/2025, 18:20 - +254 728 831490: So from third  year count 5 crops  then  do cycle  change
03/01/2025, 18:22 - +254 726 790922: 30kgs?
03/01/2025, 18:23 - +254 711 269400: I agree....but from an entrepreneur perspective....SL does much better on production, despite it's production costs......the return on investment is noticable? Or is it?

03/01/2025, 18:29 - +254 720 698206: With proper splaying program CBD/CLR is a non issue.
03/01/2025, 20:08 - +254 728 831490: Spray programme  for SL starts  from  before  onset  of rains then continue after every 4 weeks  until  maturity  and the chemicals  are so expensive  so that  can  not be non issue
03/01/2025, 20:10 - +254 728 831490: Remember  any input  before  harvesting  is cost of production
03/01/2025, 20:12 - +254 728 831490: Also coffee  consumers  where  we are heading  prefer  very  minimal  use of chemicals
03/01/2025, 20:23 - +254 728 831490: Also  farmers  considering the spacing  for R11 its 1000 trees  in 1 acre for such a farmer  he only needs to attain  only 10 kgs  to attain  10 000kgs  of cherry. For SL the farmer  must attain  20kgs to get  the same
03/01/2025, 20:25 - +254 728 831490: So when  doing  comparison  for R11 you have  to take  2 trees  against  1 for SL considering tree  population
03/01/2025, 20:27 - +254 720 698206: That spacing very challenging with pest and deasses control üôè

05/01/2025, 19:11 - +254 722 593749: Sure. I worked for a Company called Pinahlense in Sao Paulo. We developed colour sorters to separate ripe, over ripe, underipe cherries. Very easy and cheap. That's why Brazilian coffee knocks everyone out of International Market. ..... because it's cheaply produced thus highly competitive
05/01/2025, 19:13 - +254 728 831490: I also that's  is why even  if we say our coffee  is of high quality  in terms  of production  we produce  under  1%
05/01/2025, 19:15 - +254 727 313906: Isn't quality compromised?
05/01/2025, 19:16 - +254 722 593749: Correct. Technology is the key aspect. Of course Kenya is renowned for producing the Best coffee flavour. But we lack volumes and the cost of production is quite high since we do selective hand picking
05/01/2025, 19:16 - +254 720 698206: At New York future market, they are achieving,$3.2 per kilo while at Nairobi auction we very often achieve,$7,+.
05/01/2025, 19:16 - +254 728 831490: In kenya  what about  if the government  supported 2 million farmers  each to plant  1 acre?
05/01/2025, 19:17 - +254 722 593749: Of course it is. But the volumes of Coffee that Brazil presents in the market overrides any serious coffee producing country
05/01/2025, 19:18 - +254 722 593749: Sure. Are we in coffee business surely?
05/01/2025, 19:18 - +254 721 747411: Kenya seed had a sorter on colour , size etc
Things made easy, imagine the time that would be freed to do other things!
05/01/2025, 19:20 - +254 721 747411: Doing these maths with our coperatives and we are on course
05/01/2025, 19:21 - +254 720 698206: Our problem is international branding,we produce premium specialty coffee but is sold as just any coffee At Our auction.International buyers give us a premium but not the real value.They make a killing when they sell our coffee to specialty coffee shops internationally. <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 19:24 - +254 728 831490: Also i urge farmers  lets  all work hard to increase  production per tree to a minimum  of 10kgs  then  increase  our volumes  so that we can  have a say
05/01/2025, 19:25 - +254 722 593749: Correct. This can be easily achieved without much effort
05/01/2025, 19:34 - +254 722 721900: Getting 10kgs   on average ,per stem consistently, isn't easy.  I would like to know the trick/ formula.
05/01/2025, 19:37 - +254 727 313906: The problem is coffee berries do not ripen at the same time.
05/01/2025, 19:54 - +254 721 747411: True, this was in response to machine harvesting 
Most grains need sorting!
05/01/2025, 20:22 - +254 722 593749: They usually let ripening to be achieved to about 65%. Of course most are overripes
05/01/2025, 20:51 - +254 710 261246: This is very possible Hon Mathenge, with good Agronomy practices and diligent farming practices
05/01/2025, 20:51 - +254 710 261246: <Media omitted>
05/01/2025, 21:49 - +254 722 442781: I believe you . 10kgs is achievable with good agronomical practices.  
Our major problem in kenya is PRODUCTION per tree . Even with an average price of 80 Bob per kg of cherry,  a farmer producing an average of 10kgs per tree will always make good money ..whether cartels exists or not .
Our main focus should be on the following. 
1. Good pruning. 
2. Adequate feeding 
3. Adequate pest and diseases control. 
4. Adequate moisture conservation through application of thick layer of mulch and basins around the tree .
5. We must love coffee..
05/01/2025, 21:53 - +254 722 442781: We focus on what we can control.
I visited Kimathi University farm, and they showed me a record of their demo farm, and they had achieved 42kgs from 1 tree . 
Just imagine with all the knowledge , their commercial farm production was under 10kgs because they couldn't feed commercial coffee like in the demo plots üòÖüòÖüòÖ.
05/01/2025, 21:55 - +254 727 313906: Ten years ago I harvested 400 kg from my 423 bushes. This year I have harvested 5467kg,and before the close of the season I expect to go close to 6000kg. I thought it was not possible but after befriending my bushes I expect to even get better output. <This message was edited>

05/01/2025, 22:12 - Henry Kinyua: Commercial farms at universities in  Kenya from UoN, JKUAt and DeKut etc are unable to access inputs on time due to bureaucracies in procurement. But knowledge on how to increase yield and others they have

05/01/2025, 22:18 - +254 722 442781: So farmers and experts, it is easy to get 20kgs per tree . Let's feed our coffee . I saw fertiliser recommendation from Korea of 800g of NPK per tree
05/01/2025, 22:19 - +254 722 442781: One fertiliser that coffee farmers should keep away from is C.A.N because it is too much money for a single nutrient.
05/01/2025, 22:19 - +254 727 140450: How many kilos do they realize from such trees?
05/01/2025, 22:19 - Henry Kinyua: Very easy. In the 80s and 90s the average per bush in Nyeri club was 15kgs.
05/01/2025, 22:20 - +254 722 442781: Good question,  I will go back to the literature to findout
05/01/2025, 22:20 - +254 727 140450: The cost of inorganic fertilizers is an impediment
05/01/2025, 22:21 - Henry Kinyua: Not just fertilizer, but also fungicides and insecticides and with CBD a slight delay can and do lead to huge losses
05/01/2025, 22:21 - +254 722 442781: Fertiliser is the only input  that does not increase the cost of production per kg unless one is above the optimum point which is highly unlikely in kenya ..
05/01/2025, 22:23 - +254 727 140450: Even for other crops most Kenyan farmers under fertilize
05/01/2025, 22:24 - +254 722 442781: Organic fertilisers are the most expensive if one was to match their  nutrients with inorganic..
05/01/2025, 22:24 - +254 722 854576: Brazil coffee is mostly conillon- a robusta coffee and most is dry processed not washed. Produced in large farms.
05/01/2025, 22:24 - +254 722 442781: 100%.
05/01/2025, 22:27 - +254 727 140450: But farmers can make an effort to make organic manures in their farms
05/01/2025, 22:38 - +254 722 507436: We need to discuss regenerative agriculture in coffee and sustainable soil health to address current and future challenges.
05/01/2025, 22:41 - +254 722 442781: What we need to tell farmers is that manure and fertilisers are not alike, and both are necessary

JANUARY MAJOR BEST PRACTICES.pdf
06/01/2025, 07:22 - +254 711 996042: Which variety of coffee?
06/01/2025, 07:41 - +254 711 269400: In a consistent basis, yes this is achievable.....however, this has been left, for commercial farmers in the country, to test and retest their agronomy expertise driven by revenues,  I wish the research team (the CRIs) could have better info on GAPs regarding the commercial varieties, and prorated for a period of 14 years to determine, even after coffee has undergone two or 3 conversion cycles.......this is the absolute kg production per tree......with the average cost of production having been factored in
06/01/2025, 08:26 - +254 711 996042: Which variety?
06/01/2025, 08:37 - +254 728 268300: That's it!
06/01/2025, 08:51 - +254 727 313906: Ruiru grafted,batian and a few SL 28
06/01/2025, 08:58 - +254 711 996042: Ok.
06/01/2025, 10:42 - +254 735 819129: Kindly please! Come clear about this. I mean Elaborate about it
06/01/2025, 10:55 - +254 794 960669: It's clear as it's, remember CAN contain only one macro nutrients i.e Nitrogen in different forms nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrate, plus Calcium and Sulfur
06/01/2025, 11:06 - +254 722 442781: In almost all formulation, it is calcium ammonium nitrate adding up to 26% N . Calcium, in most cases, is too little to give value .
Now assume 22:6:12 is going for ksh 4500 per a bag of 50 and C.A.N is at 4000. 
Which one would you buy ?.
06/01/2025, 11:07 - +254 722 442781: Using this , you can calculate the value of each nutrients per kg .
06/01/2025, 11:13 - +254 735 819129: This is very well understood but why do coffee agronomist always advice to apply CAN or either if they are aware of this? Look at coffee calendars.
06/01/2025, 11:17 - +254 722 442781: I think the problem lies with our training system, which is against questioning documented materials.
06/01/2025, 11:19 - +254 722 442781: Another example is CBD resistance in Ruiru and Batian, which is not absolute.. I have witnessed CDB infections in the two varieties, which may contribute up to 10 to 15% loss .
06/01/2025, 11:29 - +254 735 819129: I would wish that this forum identifies the coffee Agronomists among us so that we can be directing our challenges to them at. Like this issue of CAN,I was advised to drop it by foliar feeds supply after going through a chain of problems with my crops especially CLR related challenges. Upon testing the guy's advice,a difference started showing up.
06/01/2025, 11:39 - +254 722 442781: Mmhh . Let me say this . Foliars can't substitute soil applied fertilisers because their formulation limits carry enough fertiliser materials due to the effects of scorching.  

1 bag of 22.6.12 has an equivalent of 11kgs of N , while one litre if foliar eg 24.24.18 has 240g of N .
Tunaskizana ? 
Foliars are not recommended for correcting major nutrient difficiencies .
06/01/2025, 11:41 - +254 722 442781: Foliars are to crops what Vegatables are to human beings , necessary but can't be used as Major diet ..
06/01/2025, 11:50 - +254 722 442781: Foliars are necessary carriers for trace elements, and it is advisable to spray at least 1 foliar spray per month if not 2 ..

06/01/2025, 12:10 - +254 722 722791: What we need are more crop and site specific fertilizers that carry micro nutrients as well... Formulations should be adjusted for crop nutrition and not blanket application as mostly currently happens...
06/01/2025, 12:22 - +254 735 819129: Tunaskizana vizuri Sana. I once read from this forum a fellow farmer from West rift valley complaining of CLR in association with excessive application of CAN in SLs. My conclusion was that CLR has high affinity to nitrogen. Your suggestion to reduce CAN application to reduce production costs has shed more light.  Same nitrogen is found in npk. You have clarified for us the available nitrogen for coffee uptake in CAN. Can you go a head and clarify what is the available nitrogen for coffee uptake in npk?
06/01/2025, 12:29 - +254 735 819129: There has been contagious complaints from fellow neighboring coffee farmers over coffee bean abortions 7-14 days after CAN applications. This is after the onset of heavy rains. What is your take over the same ?
06/01/2025, 12:39 - +254 722 442781: Since trace elements are required by plants in small quantities,  foliar application is always the best, while the soil applied ones can carry the macro nutrients.  

What the foliar manufacturer are doing these days is to put Macro nutrients in foliar as supplements. 
This is important because, without irrigation, basal fertlizers can only be applied during rains . Therefore foliars nikama bitings as you wait for the main course.
06/01/2025, 12:55 - +254 724 455213: Plants are able to absorb nutrients using roots and shoots. However, plant nutrition requires feeding via both systems. As a rule; use Compound fertilizers and foliar feeds. Don't take advise from Marketers, ask a competent Agronomist then contact the dealers for specific products.

06/01/2025, 14:49 - +254 722 593749: I like how healthy discussions on coffee matters take place in this forum. One thing that's coming out clear is that what works best for one farmer may not automatically work for another. Our experiences are quite as diverse as our farms and conditions which are different even when comparing 2 farms adjacent to each other.
C.A.N application is a controversial issue and not quite clear. It's assimilation and uptake as a straight inorganic fertiliser that only supplies Nitrogen makes leaf surface to develop softness and succulence making which is a predisposing condition for proliferation of CLR.
Farmers who've substituted it's use with compound N.P.K have noted a significant drop in the incidences of CBD & CLR.
However as I'll always advise successful coffee farming is a combination of several factors and agronomy practices in the coffee farm.
06/01/2025, 15:04 - +254 735 819129: Let this be made louder.

PLANTING COFFEE - 1.
 *Land preparation and spacing.* 
Planting is the foundation of every crop such as perennials, annuals and also biennials.It refers to the process of putting seeds or young plants(seedlings) in the ground to grow.
In coffee,planting involves placing prenurtured seedlings to the ground and its the second stage of coffee production after nursery management.

Reasons for planting coffee.
1.To increase land acreage with coffee.
2.Fill gaps in coffee field
3.To start new coffee farm in a land that was initially for other purpose.
4.Replace old varieties with disease resistant varieties such as Batian and Ruiru 11.

Coffee growing land should:
‚Ä¢Be a land owned by the farmer since coffee is a long-term crop.
‚Ä¢Be well drained.Thus avoid waterlogged land.
‚Ä¢Fallow land or that which is due to be fallow after harvest of food crop.

Land to avoid when planting coffee:
-Land that is used for main food crops production.
-Land that is forested. Coffee planted in Land that was initially a forest will have high incidences of Armillaria and MUST be avoided.

 *Land preparation to plant coffee.* 
This should be done in the month of January to February.Land preparation involves:
‚Ä¢Digging out perennial weeds while the annual ones can be slashed so as not to leave the soil bare
‚Ä¢Prepare terraces and plant stabilising grasses along the contour if on a steep slope before planting.
‚Ä¢Plant bananas or shade trees.
‚Ä¢Mark where the holes should be in a straight line,considering the spacing.( *For this service consult -0795220161)* 

 *Spacing in coffee.* 
The spacing to be used is determined by the variety one chooses to plant.Planting coffee in correct spacing means there will be no competition for light,nutrients and water.From observation the spacing should be:
Ruiru 11 -7ft√ó7ft.
Batian     -9ft√ó9ft
Sl &K7      -9ft√ó9ft.

19/01/2025, 20:11 - +254 735 819129: Denaza! You have been of great importance to us farmers. Keep it up. You are quite resourceful. However,9*9ft for Batian has to queried. The information we have is that it is similar to Ruiru 11
19/01/2025, 20:23 - +254 727 140450: Batian and Ruiru 11 cannot have similar spacing.
CRI recommends; 
2.1mx2.4m for Batian,
2 m x 2 m for Ruiru 11 <This message was edited>
19/01/2025, 20:25 - +254 722 593749: @254735819129 the recommended spacing posed a challenge to farmers. This has been caused by interlocking branches and the tendency of Batian to grow tall making canopy management a little bit challenging
19/01/2025, 20:31 - +254 735 819129: I have also come out to learn the same problem but how did it come to be disseminated like that first?Was it a research shortfall?
19/01/2025, 20:36 - +254 722 593749: I'm not sure. But I think some breeding aspects were are yet to be finalized. However the variety does well in spacing of 7 feet X 8 feet.
19/01/2025, 20:39 - +254 711 996042: 7 and 8 fts are how metres

19/01/2025, 20:46 - +254 722 593749: Yes. 7feet =2.1 m.
8 feet= 2.4 m
19/01/2025, 20:46 - +254 727 140450: One foot is 30 cm

19/01/2025, 22:24 - +254 722 593749: Propagation. Ruiru 11 plantlets are developed from sowing pure seeds on nursery to germinate and develop in ready for transplanting in the field. Grafted Ruiru 11 plantlets are developed from a union between root stock(SL 28 or 34) and Scion (the top part of the plantlets which is either from a pure stand of Ruiru 11 or a clonal garden. Once the union heals the plantlets are ready for transplanting.

20/01/2025, 14:14 - +254 722 854576: By the way. What came researchers in the coffee sector? They don‚Äôt respond to the questions people are asking! Too busy reading and researching i guess
20/01/2025, 14:27 - +254 722 593749: Hehehehe üòÇüòÇüòÇ hopefully.
20/01/2025, 14:28 - +254 722 442781: A tree with a large canopy is also expected to have  big and deep roots than that with a smaller canopy.  It is a fact that SL varieties have bigger canopies and, therefore, deeper root systems.  
If SL is allowed to establish to over 8 years and then budded with Ruiru 11, automatically Ruiru will benefit from the deeper root system attained as a result of carrying a bigger canopy.

If a young rootstock of SL is grafted with a  Ruiru scion  , logically, it will not develop a deeper root system as it would normally happen when carrying a larger canopy. 
This is my theory, and I am sure grafting SL with Ruiru scion is also a theory.
20/01/2025, 14:37 - +254 722 442781: roots are difficult to study under field conditions, canopy temperature has been applied as an indirect way of assessing the root depth as higher water uptake and leaf transpiration is related to a cooler canopy. Canopy stay-green characters

05/02/2025, 12:00 - +254 795 220161: *MAJOR BEST AGRONOMIC PRACTICES(BAPs) IN COFFEE FOR FEBRUARY 2025.* 
(By Agronomist Dennis wa Mkulima kahawa mkononi)
 _Hole digging and shade tree establishment for new farm._

One month for 2025 is gone.Three important questions a farmer will need to ask themselves.What is my goal and target in yields for my coffee farm?What did i do in January that will help me achieve my goal?Am i still enthusiastic to follow guidance and seek advice from a professional agronomist to help achieve my target?
My hope its that these questions will help guide you all through.

Remember:The long days agriculture is far much gone;nowadays we are in an era of kilimo Biashara (Agriculture for money/profits).If its not this,a good advice ,abandon it.

The major Best Agronomic Practices for coffee this February 2025 includes:
1.Prunning and rejuvenation.
Its disappointing walking to some farms to find out that some farmers are yet to prune.Prunning is a requirement that need not to be ignored.Its what the coffee requires to flower well, flowering will inturn determine the yields.On the other hand, Rejuvenation or the changing of cycle will help get yields for a  long period.Do these before flowering.

2.Weeding and Mulching 
Weeds compete with the coffee plant for water and nutrients.Ensure under the canopy its weedfree and mulched.Slash between rows.

3.Fertilization and Liming.
Its important applying lime in your farm, either dolomitic or calcium lime as per the recommendation of a soil test.
Apply a general foliar,wuxual,omex,biofol,calcibor,zinc and boron.You can as well use Peekgrow(an organic foliar customised for coffee).If the berries are still expanding and the early crop much,ensure you do the foliar sprays with high NPK .

4.Hole digging and shade tree planting.
I believe some of us want to extend our coffee farms, some are beginning to farm coffee and infilling.
Ensure you dig a good hole by end of this month.Even though a 2ft x 2ft is the recommended hole,a 3ft x 3ft has,from experience,done well .Lets Discuss this in the next article this month.
Its important if you are a start up or intend to extend your farm to plant shade trees after you are done with hole digging.

 *NOTE :* 
‚Ä¢ *Composting* - Its important you continue making compost for applying on your trees come April.
 *‚Ä¢Record Keeping* -Its agribusiness we are in,thus recording keeping is key to trace farm activities and the cost.
 *‚Ä¢Soil testing* -Ensure you do a soil test to know the nutrient need for your farm.

*COFFEE PLANTING 2:* 

*THE PROCESS OF HOLE DIGGING FOR PLANTING COFFEE & AVOCADO.* 

 _The best hole for planting coffee and Avocado._

What are the me best measurements?
Relating a 2ft √ó2ft by a 3ft x 3ft hole.
Why dig a hole.
How(Steps) to dig a hole for coffee planting.

In construction works,the foundation laid relates to the type of house being constructed.The taller the building,the stronger the foundation will be.
The foundation in coffee agribusiness is how we plant.Thus, planting is very crucial and key and should be thorough and done professionally.

Coffee seedlings are planted in holes when there are rains or the soil has enough moisture.Holes should be dug 2 months before actual planting.

We dig holes in coffee to:
1.Break the hardpans in soil to allow for easier root penetration.
2.Allows for easier penetration of water and air during seeding growth.

 *What is the best size for a coffee hole?*

Even though a 2ft x 2ft hole is the recommended and works well,a 3ft x 3ft hole(from a number of farmers experience) has proven to give much better results. This is because of the ease and faster  root elongation due to deep loose soil which also facilitates trunk and branches elongation.
We will discuss more during backfilling and actual planting.

 *Steps to digging a good quality hole:* 

Hoping you as a farmer has already done land preparation in January,you will now follow the following steps:
1. Mark your farm and space the the marks depending with the Variety.Use pegs to mark.
2. Dig the hole 3ft x3ft x3ft using a fork Jembe.The top soil(1.5ft) should be put separate from the Subsoil .Ensure the peg is at the centre as you dig the hole.
3. Mark the top soil using a peg .Do this for each hole.You will require this to mix with manure during backfilling.
4. Leave the hole open for about A month . It's left open so that it can gets cracks which will make water infiltration efficient and facilitate good root development.

 *NOTE:* 
1. *Soil testing* is very key at this stage of hole digging if you didn't do it in January.Ensure you test your soil.
2. Also plant shade trees in the coffee farms at this stage . Plant such trees as albizia,crotin,Markhamia,Cordia or even a food crop as Banana's.
3. Make terraces before hole digging if its on a sloping land.
4. Don't spray at your coffee when there are flowers. Let them fall first.
5. For the coffee with a crop, spray zinc and boron foliars and alsohigh NPK foliars .

 *Sources for Raw Coffee Beans for Export:* 

A) *National Coffee Exchange (NCE)* ‚Äì Coffee can be sourced through the NCE via the auction system by participating in bidding.
B) *Direct Sales* ‚Äì Coffee can also be sold directly to international buyers, but this requires specific agreements and approval from the Coffee Directorate.

 *Exporter Requirements: Rules and Regulations* 
To become a licensed coffee exporter in Kenya, the following key requirements must be met:

1. *Export License* 
Issued by the Coffee Directorate under the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA). This confirms that the exporter complies with the Coffee Act regulations.

2. *Certificate of Origin* 
Issued by the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI). This document verifies that the coffee being exported is grown and produced in Kenya.

3. *Phytosanitary Certificate* 
Issued by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS). This certificate ensures that the coffee is free from pests and diseases, and meets international phytosanitary standards.

 *Key Procedures for Coffee Export* 

1. Registration with the Coffee Board (now under AFA) ‚Äì All exporters must register with the relevant authority.
2. Obtaining an Export License ‚Äì A valid export license is mandatory for all exporters.
3. Quality Standards ‚Äì Exporters must ensure the coffee meets the required quality standards for grading and classification.
4. Obtaining Phytosanitary Certificates ‚Äì Ensure the coffee meets health and safety requirements by obtaining this certificate.
5. Obtaining a Certificate of Origin ‚Äì Confirm that the coffee is produced in Kenya.
6. Coffee Sample Submission ‚Äì Buyers may request coffee samples for quality analysis and grading.
7. Compliance with Export Regulations ‚Äì All export procedures, including customs declarations and documentation, must be followed in accordance with Kenyan export regulations.

Phosphorus is a major nutrient,its required in high quantities by the plants.

 *Importance of Phosphorus.* 
‚Ä¢ Phosphorus is essential for root development and energy transfer within the plant. 
‚Ä¢  It's essential for flower development and fruit set.

 *Causes of Phosphorus Deficiency* 

1. In tropical soils, phosphates can form with *low solubilities* , making phosphorus immobile
2. *High demand for phosphorus* can coincide with *dry soil conditions.* This explains why during the dry months,its deficiency is evident .

 *Deficiency Diagnosis.*
The Symptoms includes:-
1. *Older leaves* develop irregular *yellow* areas that may spread to the whole leaf.
2. Leaves may turn red or violet under severe conditions.
3. Leaves may develop a purple or bronze tint.
4. Leaves may be smaller than normal
5. Flowering and fruit set may be delayed or reduced.

 *Correction*
1. Use organic manures.
2. Apply high Phosphorus foliars.
3. Apply single superphosphate to treat deficiency symptoms.

Symptoms and damage

Wood shavings extruded by larvae burrowing in the stem
Ring-barking at the base of the trunk
Oblong holes visible on the trunks left by larvae after entering the trunk
Visible round holes on trunks left by emerging adults
Yellowing of foliage and eventual death of trees


Management

Mechanical control

Kill the larva(e) that is already in the stem by inserting a wire/spoke into the tunnel
Physically collect and kill the beetle at the onset of rains
Chemical control

Paint or spray a 90 cm band above the ground on the coffee trunk with a recommended insecticide. Repeat after one year and every second year.
Insert a cotton ball soaked in an insecticide through the tunnel in incidences where the larva has entered into the stem.

*Coffee leaf rust.*
 _Hemileia vastatrix_

‚Ä¢This is a disease affecting the Sl and K7 variety.
‚Ä¢Its Spread mostly by raindrops and is prevalent in hot climates.
‚Ä¢Can also be spread by wind,animals and even humans as they pass through the farm

 *Economic importance:*
‚Ä¢Leads to leaf fall reducing 'food factory'  this the whole coffee tree can dry up 
‚Ä¢Can reduce to crop fail.

 *IPDM Strategy.*
‚Ä¢Good prunning and rejuvenation.
‚Ä¢Proper feeding (nutrition)
‚Ä¢Reducing stress by weeding and shading.
‚Ä¢ *Planting resistant variety* as Ruiru 11 and Batian.
‚Ä¢Preventive copper fungicides.
‚Ä¢Curative fungicides as ,Classic,twiga hypox and tabibu.Always alternate these for effective control.
‚Ä¢Control  when  10%(1 out of 10) leaves is affected.

21/02/2025, 07:34 - +254 795 220161: *Mealybugs and Scales* 

These pests are found on the growing area of the coffee plant where they suck the sweet sap from the plant and may lead to drying up of the plant.

‚Ä¢Also blackening of the leaves that hinder photosynthesis processes in the plant due to formation of mould due to the sugary excrete.

 *The association between Mealybugs,scales and black ant (Thigiriri)*
‚Ä¢This answers the question why leaves blackens.
‚Ä¢The scales and mealybugs suck sugary sap and excretes.
‚Ä¢The black ants feeds on the sugary excrete thus removes the waste from the plant.
‚Ä¢The excrete would otherwise eliminate the scales and mealybugs naturally.
‚Ä¢As these three moves they leave marks of the sugary excrete on leaf surfaces and berries.
‚Ä¢Mould that is in the air grows on the leaves thus they blacken.

 *Management of the pests.*
‚Ä¢During Scouting,the presence of black ants moving up and down the coffee tree justifies presence of the scakes and mealybugs.
‚Ä¢Spray a tank mix of Segatron (50ml) OR D-ctron oil(100ml) and teepol(50ml) in a 20l pump.
‚Ä¢Spot spray(Selective)only the affected trees in the farm.
‚Ä¢Prune branches touching the ground.

Good morning,
Lime application.
It is essential to lower the pH thus increasing availability of nutrients.
Its important applying lime in the dry periods for agricultural and dolomitic limes or during wet weather for calcigrow ,wondergrow etc.
Apply as per recommendations of a soil test.
22/02/2025, 08:57 - +254 721 552757: Lime does not lower the pH; it raises the pH but lowers the acidity.
22/02/2025, 09:01 - +254 795 220161: Sure lowering the acidity

22/02/2025, 13:58 - +254 795 220161: TO DO BEFORE END OF
FEBRUARY 2025 IN THE COFFEE FARMS.:

Its important that by the end of this month that every farmer should have :
1. Dug planting holes(3ft x 3ft).
2. Done soil testing 
3. Lime application -To lower acidity and raise pH.
4. Weeded and mulched the coffee farms.
5. Sprayed a general foliar as Biofol,wuxual,omex, Peekgrow and Zinc and Boron foliars.
6. Spray preventive fungicide as green copper and if leaf rust is evident spray curative fungicides .This is for those with the Susceptible varieties as Sl and K7 .

Advantages of proper  spacing in coffee. 
Proper coffee plant spacing is crucial because it directly impacts the coffee yield by allowing adequate sunlight, air circulation, and root development for each plant, leading to healthier growth and higher quality coffee bean.

Spacing:
1. Ruiru 11 -CRI recommends 6ft x6 ft but  a 7ft x 8ft has worked well .
2. Batian 8ft x 9ft has also worked well.(The recommendations for CRI 7 ft by 8ft)
3. Sl and K7 varieties,: 9ft by 9ft.

NB// The system a farmer chooses to use whether single -stem or multiple stems also determines the spacing.

THE VALUE OF SECONDARY BRANCHES IN COFFEE.
A secondary branch is that branch originating from a primary branch  in a coffee plant.
Secondary branches¬†should be:
‚Ä¢ 6 inches from the stem, 
‚Ä¢ 2 knots apart, 
‚Ä¢  On alternating sides.
‚Ä¢ Should only be on the part of the primary branch that has been harvested 
‚Ä¢Secondary branches should be left out during prunning.

As the primary branch age, mostly especially on all other variety apart from Ruiru grafted,the productivity goes towards the tip of the branch.This necessities the need for secondary branches.
Thus,the secondary branches help increase yields in terms of quantity.

‚Ä¢Leave only *4-6 secondary branches* on one primary Branch.

Symptoms

On flowers: Dark brown blotches/streaks on the petals.  Flowers may be destroyed but loses from flower infection are generally not serious
On green berries: Small dark sunken patches/lesions which spread rapidly and may cover the whole berry. Infected berries may be shed or remain on the trees in a black shriveled condition  
On ripe berries: Dark sunken lesions with black dots spreading rapidly on the ripe berries (late Blight)
On leaves: Brown marginal spots. However, leaf infection is not common 
Severe infections may cause the die-back of twigs and branches
24/02/2025, 12:24 - +254 701 641933: Conditions favoring high disease incidences

Cool temperatures ‚Äì 18-200 C
High humidity - encourages spores production
Rainfall ‚Äì rain droplets disperse the spores to the rest of the tree. After the dispersal, at least 5 hours of wetness on the berries are required for the spores to germinate. Rainfall occurring in the late afternoon is therefore likely to provide suitable conditions for infection

24/02/2025, 21:24 - +254 701 641933: Key benefits of using solar dryers for coffee in Kenya:
Quality Improvement:
Solar dryers provide a controlled drying environment, ensuring even drying of coffee cherries, preventing uneven heating and preserving the coffee bean's flavor profile and aroma. 
Faster Drying Time:
Compared to traditional sun drying, solar dryers significantly reduce drying time, allowing farmers to process more coffee in a shorter period. 
Weather Protection:
The enclosed design protects coffee beans from rain and dust contamination, which can significantly impact quality, especially during unpredictable weather conditions. 
Labor Efficiency:
Solar dryers require less manual labor as they automatically regulate the drying process, reducing the need for constant turning and monitoring. 
Cost-Effectiveness:
By minimizing drying time and improving quality, solar dryers can lead to higher market prices for coffee, offsetting the initial investment cost. 
Environmental Sustainability:
Solar dryers utilize renewable solar energy, contributing to a reduced carbon footprint compared to fossil fuel-based drying methods.
24/02/2025, 21:34 - +254 720 464900: This is good the pros definitely are more than the probable cons and having them is a big plus.

25/02/2025, 12:13 - +254 735 819129: I personally believe undershade coffee drying is best for best coffee cup quality as compared to green house drying tho the later have more advantages to the farmer. Slow coffee bean drying retains original production  qualities than green house drying. With slow drying, coffee flavour and nutrients are well preserved to the later and thus better cup quality. Take for example you dry maize or beans in a shade then only last sun dry to attain the required moisture content for milling(maize) or cooking for dried beans . Rapidly sun dry the same above and prepare a menu after attaining the same moisture content levels. You will notice a very big difference in both quality and density. This is my suggestion.
25/02/2025, 12:24 - +254 722 593749: Interesting observation. Rapid drying from green house (parabolic solar dryer) saves on time and costs of labour since in beds we need to frequently turn the parchment which in solar dryer requires little work force.In addition, in the evening we need to cover beds in nylex; an extra cost, the solar dryer has an advantage in that parchment can dry rapidly and delivered timely incase the society wants to cash in on competitive market auctions delivering within the required timeliness.

26/02/2025, 17:26 - +254 795 220161: *Effective Scouting and Monitoring for Pest and deficiency Control in Sustainable Farming."* 

‚Ä¢Crop scouting is the practice of observing crops to identify potential issues like pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies.
‚Ä¢ It's a key part of crop management that can help growers make informed decisions and optimize yields. 

 *Why scout.?* 
‚Ä¢ Helps identify problems early so they don't cause significant damage 
‚Ä¢Helps growers take proactive measures to improve crop health and yield.
‚Ä¢Helps growers monitor the spread of pests and diseases.
‚Ä¢Helps growers detect nutritional requirements.

Scouting process.
First its good sampling a number of crops to scout from.In coffee its advisable to scot atleast 5 per 200stems,in Avocado scout 10 out of 100 trees.
After samplin scout by:-
1. By closely inspecting plants for signs of stress, pests, and diseases 
2. By using insect traps, such as sticky traps and pheromones 
3. By randomly inspecting plants throughout the production area 
4. By gathering and recording information about a particular crop on a regular basis.

 *Note:* 
‚Ä¢In a serious farmer will scout their coffee/avocado farm atleast twice a week.
‚Ä¢Scout often if you identify a pest or you are controlling it.
‚Ä¢Don't scout those in the neighborhood but you can place traps to know direction of pests.
‚Ä¢Understand deficiencies to be able to note them.

27/02/2025, 22:17 - +254 795 220161: *A REPORT FROM A FARM VISIT CONDUCTED IN MRS.KIDUNA'S FARM IN KAMUCEGE,KAMBU ON 27/02/2025.*

CROPS:
COFFEE & BANANA'S.
Coffee- 2700 stems.
 Bananas -120.

This report is as a result of history taken and observations made during scouting on the day of visit .

 *Results and observations:* 
-Banana's are doing well apart from a few that have dried up due to wilt and some moles.
-Some stumps have many suckers emerging.
 *Coffee:*
-Lime application done on mulch.
-Manure had been applied in sime part of the farm despite the high temperatures.
-Rejuvenation has been done and the farm has young stems.
-Prunning has been done correctly.
-Shade levels very low or none at all 
-The small seedlings are drying up due to sun's intensity.
-2024 yields was at 5300kg for the 2700stems in the farm.Gives an average of 1.96kgs/tree.
-Weeding well done.Herbicides used in some parts.
-Mulching has been done.
-No major pests and diseases.
-Mbuni's are still on the trees.
-Copper sprays to the grafted Ruiru .

 *Recommendations*:
Target 2025 - 13500kg (5kg/tree).
What to do?
1. Always apply half debe of fully composted manure in the long rains and short rains. Twice a year.
       You can as well alternate with        organic fertilizer.
2. Apply 160g/tree of NPK fertilizer 22.6.12 +S in the months of April and October, 2weeks after the rains.
3. Lime application.Apply 500g of agricultural lime per tree as demonstrated having removed the mulch.All land should be covered with lime in time of application.
4. Bananas: Apply NPK and manure with the rains.
-Also , for those that have dried,replace them with new suckers and apply lime before planting.
-Prune the suckers to have 4-5stems per stump.Also prune the banana leaves.
5. *Foliar sprays:* 
For Ruiru,its a heavy feeder.Thus,using foliars really helps to keep the crop.Thus spray foliars of zinc and boron and high NPK foliars as wuxual,biofol or omex, peekgrow every month.
-Spray also adaptive copper as feeds during the dry months or if green copper (70g).
-Also in the next 2 sprays,use calcibor.

6. Spray pesticides after scouting and identifying a pest
7. *Don't* use  herbicides to kill weeds 
8. *Biodiversity* Plant avocadoes(Hass ) on the hedges of the coffee farm and at the centre on the onset of raains.
9. Irrigation 
 With the high effect of climate change.Its good irrigating the coffee farm.and Mulching.

See the below photos for the farm.Thanks .

 *MAJOR BEST AGRONOMIC PRACTICES(BAPs) FOR MARCH _2025* 
(By Agronomist Dennis Wa Mkulima Kahawa Mkononi_ ).

The main challenge with most coffee farmers in the World is the ignorance of proper timing (the 'WHEN ") for the important agronomic practices. 

Correct timing for the Best Agronomic Practices(BAPs) in coffee farming is key to the final results of coffee production.
Here are the major practices to do in your coffee farms: 

1. *Backfilling of planting holes.* 
  How:-Organic materials chopped first(not a necessity,you can just mix soil).
In March we will know whyto backfill.
-Top soil mixed with manure
-Fill with subsoil mixed with manure untill the hole is heaped.
-Before the whole hole is covered,place a peg in the middle of the hole.

2. *Seedling acquisition and booking.-* Bring them near the farm where there is water and in an open field.
     ‚Ä¢Ensure you get certified seedlings.

3. Composting for use in coffee farms.Use organic wastes.

4. Weeding and mulching -weeds reduce yields by half through competing for nutrients with the coffee plant.
      ‚Ä¢Mulching helps prevent weed growth when it rains.

5. Acquisition of Fertilizer,DAP for planting , NPK fertilizer  for tue crop and manure/organic fertilizer.) 
‚Ä¢For organic fertilizer reach out to me.
‚Ä¢ *The fertilizer type is dependent on the results of a soil test.* 

6. *Foliar sprays* 
High NPK foliars are important for the bearing crop and zinc and Boron.
Akso spray captain P.

7. *Soil erosion control methods*  -terraces,gabions,mulch.
   ‚Ä¢ Its important controlling and preventing soil erosion with the coming rains.

02/03/2025, 18:10 - +254 724 455213: Seems like a combination of factors with sun burn being the main issue with evident cases of chemical scorch. Some shading in a coffee plantation is important,  also time for chemical application under the current weather should be observed.

02/03/2025, 18:15 - +254 721 552757: This is bacterial blight of coffee (BBC) caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. Garcae.
It used to be confined to a few coffee growing areas in Kenya (Solai in Nakuru District and around Mt. Elgon). Recently a few cases have been reported in the East of Rift Valley.
02/03/2025, 18:16 - +254 722 240407: null
02/03/2025, 18:17 - +254 721 552757: The disease is favoured by cool wet weather. Lesions appear on leaves with water soaked margins at the start of infection. Leaves eventually dry up and roll inwards turning brown. Dead and dried leaves do not shed but remain attached to the plant. Symptoms occur on secondary or tertiary branches and in severe cases the heads may be affected. On twigs the terminal bud is attacked. Infection then extends downwards, resulting in dieback. Flowers and pin-heads shrivel and turn black.

The initial symptom is the blackening of a node often accompanied by blackening of the petiole and basal part of the leaf. This leads to death of the branch above the node and leaves on the branch turn brown and eventually necrotic (burnt). Severely affected trees appear scorched as if by fire. The bacterium persists on leaves, berries and on green and mature bark. During cool, wet weather, the bacterium multiplies and initiates an epidemic. The entire crop may be lost.
02/03/2025, 18:23 - +254 721 552757: How to control:
1. Desucker or cut off infected twigs (at least 5 cm from the point of infection) and collect them for burning.
2. Observe field hygiene by disinfecting tools used for pruning infected trees with a suitable disinfectant such as spirits with 70% alcohol. Implements used must be sterilised after making each cut to avoid the risk of infecting the cut surfaces of the twig with a carry-over inoculum.
3. Though not a fungal disease, use of copper sprays especially during wet seasons helps in controlling it. Spray at 2 week interval during the rains and 3 week interval after the rains. If you are in the hotspots, you can adopt spraying with copper just before, during and after flowering especially when this coincides with cool wet weather.
4. It is advisable to plant shade trees and wind breaks on exposed sides of BBC areas.
5. Avoid planting materials (seeds and seedlings) from known BBC areas.

02/03/2025, 18:30 - +254 721 552757: Yes. It has been in Nyeri for several years now since around 2012.
02/03/2025, 18:32 - +254 721 552757: It gets worse in areas prone to hailstorm because the pathogen gains entry through lesions created by the hail stones and breakages caused by wind or any other physical damage.
02/03/2025, 18:35 - +254 721 552757: Also common in Eldoret and some parts of Kitale.
02/03/2025, 18:43 - +254 727 140450: Blue copper is a good bactericide

02/03/2025, 20:40 - +254 722 507436: This is a good description of this problem. Hygiene and blue copper is a good control to manage this disease. Nutrition is also key and especially amino based biostimulants to boost plant defense.
02/03/2025, 20:44 - +254 725 477877: Therefore, it is advantageous to coffee under the shade of trees.

Revolutionizing Coffee Farming: How AGRI-BIOTECH FARM INTERNATIONAL Solves Low Yields and Poor Quality

At AGRI-BIOTECH FARM INTERNATIONAL, we‚Äôve seen firsthand how farmers struggle with low coffee yields and inconsistent cherry quality. Many plantations suffer due to imbalanced soil pH, poor nutrient absorption, and improper tree management, leading to underdeveloped cherries and weak production cycles. But through precision agronomic practices, we‚Äôve turned these challenges into opportunities for higher yields and better coffee quality.

The Challenge: Low Yields and Poor Cherry Development

Many coffee farmers assume that a tree loaded with cherries guarantees a high yield. However, the real secret lies in the leaf-to-fruit ratio and the weight of each individual cherry. Trees with excessive fruit and insufficient leaf support suffer from nutrient competition, leading to:
‚úîÔ∏è Small, lightweight cherries.
‚úîÔ∏è Increased number of cherries per kilogram (up to 1,000 cherries per kg in poorly managed farms).
‚úîÔ∏è Low cup quality due to insufficient sugar and nutrient concentration.

Additionally, soil pH imbalance plays a major role in nutrient absorption. Coffee trees thrive best in a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. Outside this range:

Too acidic (below 5.5): Nutrients like phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium become unavailable, leading to weak trees.

Too alkaline (above 6.5): Iron and zinc deficiencies emerge, affecting leaf health and overall growth.

With improper soil nutrition, even trees with potential for 10-20 kg per season end up producing only 2-5 kg, causing major financial losses for farmers.

Our Solution: Precision Agronomic Management for Maximum Yield

At AGRI-BIOTECH FARM INTERNATIONAL, we‚Äôve developed a tailored approach to coffee farming, focusing on:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Balanced Soil Nutrition & pH Regulation
‚úîÔ∏è We conduct soil testing to determine pH and nutrient deficiencies.
‚úîÔ∏è We apply agricultural lime where soil is too acidic, ensuring optimal nutrient absorption.
‚úîÔ∏è We use organic basal and foliar fertilizers to boost tree health and productivity.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Selective Pruning & Leaf-to-Fruit Ratio Optimization
‚úîÔ∏è We assess the physiological structure of each tree, balancing the number of cherries per branch.
‚úîÔ∏è We prune selectively, ensuring an ideal leaf-to-fruit ratio for maximum cherry weight and sugar concentration.
‚úîÔ∏è Well-pruned, healthy trees can produce 300-400 cherries per kg, compared to poorly managed trees that need 1,000 cherries per kg.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Targeted Feeding & Crop Care for Bigger, Heavier Cherries
‚úîÔ∏è Our nutrition strategy ensures that each berry develops proper weight and density, increasing overall coffee quality.
‚úîÔ∏è Farmers under our program achieve 10-20 kg per tree by aligning nutrients with physiological growth stages.
‚úîÔ∏è We focus on crop protection by reducing pest and disease pressure, ensuring cherries develop fully.

Proven Results: From Low Yields to Premium Coffee Production

Through our scientific approach, farmers experience:
‚úÖ Higher yields per tree (10-20 kg compared to 2-5 kg before intervention).
‚úÖ Increased P1 and P2 grading at the wet mill, meaning denser, high-quality coffee.
‚úÖ Healthier trees with longer productive lifespans.
‚úÖ Sustainable farming that maximizes soil health for long-term coffee success.

Your Farm Can Achieve the Same Results!

19/03/2025, 22:01 - +254 795 220161: *Best agronomic practices in coffee .you should be following up with the onset of rains:* 
( _By Agronomist Dennis wa Mkulima kahawa Mkononi_ )

1. Seedlings delivery.
I believe you had booked  seedlings for planting in your farm.Its the high time you pick them from the certified nursery you had booked from.Let them be under direct sunlight in one week time to avoid sun scorching while in the
 field.

2.Fertilizer and manure delivery.
The rains are with us, and this will be our nutrition month to our coffee and other fruit trees.
Deliver these near the farms.
Ensure you purchase the fertilizer as per the results of a,soil test.
Most soils are deficient of organic matter,if you lack manure,you can use an organic fertilizer such as *Blackgold organic fertilizer* (contact us).

3.Weeding and mulching. 
Weeds compete with plants for moisture and nutrients.In coffee,weeds reduce the yields by half.
Mulching at this time is essential after weeding as it suppress weeds.

4. De-suckering.
Its important you remove all suckers on the base of the stump unless you are changing the cycle (rejuvenating ). 
This should be done before fertilizing.

 *NOTE:* 
‚óè Avoid spraying your coffee when flowers are open.It could result to abortion. Spray after 3-4 days after the flowers emerge or after the fall with a pesticide and a high NPK foliar.
‚óèFertilizer application should be done 2weeks after the rains. Don't be in a hurry or you could waste all through leaching. 
‚óèBackfilling should be done by end of the week.

Coffee Sample Roaster: Essential Tool for Quality Control

A coffee sample roaster is designed for roasting small batches of coffee beans (50 to 300 grams) to evaluate quality before large-scale roasting or purchase. It offers precise control over temperature, airflow, and roasting time, making it essential for highlighting flavor profiles and detecting defects.

Modern sample roasters come with digital interfaces, data logging, and repeatable profiles, making them crucial for quality control labs, exporters, and specialty coffee buyers. They ensure consistency and maintain high standards in the coffee industry.

If the above roaster interests you, kindly contact us at +254 708 262 014.

*üåø ABFI TIP: Nitrogen Fixation & Rainfall ‚òî*

Did you know rain is a natural fertilizer? It adds nitrogen to your soil in two key ways:
‚úÖ During Rain:
Lightning breaks nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ) in the air, forming nitrogen oxides (NO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÉ), which dissolve in rain and enrich the soil.
Rain captures atmospheric nitrogen, boosting plant growth naturally.

‚úÖ After Rain:
Soil microbes become more active, enhancing biological nitrogen fixation (BNF).

Leguminous crops (beans, peas, clover) fix up to 200 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year with symbiotic bacteria.

Non-leguminous plants benefit from the residual nitrogen, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.

üí° How Much Nitrogen is Added?
Rainfall contributes 2 to 12 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, depending on intensity.
Lightning storms can add up to 50 kg per hectare in high-activity regions!
üåç Nature‚Äôs Free Fertilizer! Maximize rainwater benefits and plant nitrogen-fixing crops for sustainable soil health!

MAJOR BEST AGRONOMIC PRACTICES(BAPs) FOR APRIL 2025.(By Agronomist Dennis- +254795220161).
#The First  Coffee Nutrition Need# 

The main challenge with most coffee farmers in the World is the ignorance of proper timing (the 'WHEN ") for the important agronomic practices. 

Correct timing for the Best Agronomic Practices(BAPs) in coffee farming is key to the final results of coffee production.
Here are the major practices to do in your coffee farms: 

1.Desuckering.Remove all unwanted suckers *before* fertiliser and manure application in the trees you are not Rejuvenating.Remember,at this time we are interested with the berries.
2.Fertilizer application.The type of fertiliser is  determinant of the results of soil test analysis.Have your soil tested.Apply as per plant need(determine by assessing the berries available-how many kgs per tree).
You should apply 2 weeks after it rains well when the soil is moist and feeder roots are growing vigorously.
Apply along the dripline and 10cm away from the main stem. 
Use measures to apply the correct amount of fertiliser.
Applying too much fertiliser will result to leaching of much of it.Do split application. 
3. Manure application.Apply well composted manure (10L per tree).Apply along the dripline too.
4. Zinc and Boron foliar spray.These assist in berry expansion.Apply early in the morning when the temperatures are low or  in the afternoon.
5. Weeding and mulching.With moist soils,it will be easy to remove weeds in coffee farms. 
Mulching should follow after weeding,to suppress the weeds from growing.
6. Coffee planting.Having dug coffee holes(2ft√ó2ft) in January\February and Backfilling in March,we should now,with the rains do coffee planting.
(the foundation of all coffee farms)

üöú Unlock the Future of Coffee Farming with ABFI ‚òï

üå± Enhance Your Crop Health and Boost Yields with Nanocrop¬Æ Cobre! üå±
Introducing Nanocrop¬Æ Cobre ‚Äì the revolutionary solution for superior disease protection and enhanced crop production in coffee farming. This product harnesses nanotechnology to deliver unparalleled results, offering advanced protection and a range of benefits for your coffee trees.

üî¨ What Makes Nanocrop¬Æ Cobre So Unique?
Nanocrop¬Æ Cobre uses copper oxide nanoparticles‚Äîtiny particles that are 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. These microscopic particles are engineered to penetrate plant tissues much faster than conventional solutions, allowing for deeper protection and faster absorption.

Why is this so important? Nanoparticles interact with plants at a molecular level, allowing them to target disease-causing pathogens more efficiently and provide longer-lasting protection. Because the particles are so small, they can be absorbed directly into the plant, working from the inside out to bolster plant health. This means that Nanocrop¬Æ Cobre not only protects against Coffee Berry Disease (CBD), but also strengthens plants, making them more resilient to stress, pests, and other diseases.

‚úÖ Why Should You Choose Nanocrop¬Æ Cobre?

Fast Action: The nanoparticles penetrate quickly, providing immediate protection and faster results.

Long-Lasting Defense: Protection against CBD, fungal and bacterial diseases, ensuring healthier coffee trees year-round.

Boosts Plant Resilience: The nano formula helps strengthen your plants' natural defenses, leading to better resilience in harsh conditions.

Increased Yields: Healthier plants mean higher quality and increased yield, giving you more productive crops.

Eco-Friendly: The minimal copper load makes it environmentally friendly while still offering powerful results.

Cost-Effective: At Ksh 4,000 per liter, you're investing in cutting-edge technology that delivers superior protection and growth for your coffee farm.

üîß How to Use

Using Greenworld Nutriplant Organic Fertilizer on your coffee plants can offer a range of benefits‚Äîespecially if you're aiming for sustainable,high-quality yields.Here‚Äôs why it could be a smart choice:

1.It Improves Soil Health
Being organic,it enhances soil structure and increases microbial activity.

Better soil health = better nutrient availability for your coffee plants over time.


2.Balanced Nutrient Supply

Nutriplant typically contains a natural balance of nitrogen (for leafy growth), phosphorus (for strong roots) and potassium (for fruit/bean development), which are key for coffee.


3.Boosts Plant Immunity

Organic fertilizers like this often contain micronutrients and bio-stimulants that help plants resist diseases and stress from drought or pests.


4.Improves Coffee Bean Quality

Healthier plants tend to produce beans with better aroma, flavor, and size‚Äîkey for premium coffee markets.


5.Eco-Friendly

It reduces chemical runoff and is safer for beneficial insects, groundwater, and the surrounding ecosystem.


6.Slow and Steady Release

Organic fertilizers release nutrients more slowly, meaning more consistent growth and reduced risk of burning the roots

Additionally,integrating both organic and inorganic fertilizers has been shown to enhance Coffee yields.A study in some parts of mount Kenya region has found that combining organic fertilizers with inorganic fertilizers resulted in higher clean coffee yields compared to using either alone.
This suggests that a balanced approach to fertilization could be beneficial.

Hello everyone, this is to answer a question that we've come across a number of times
17/04/2025, 20:57 - +254 722 442781: Why plant in this manner ?
17/04/2025, 21:00 - +254 722 593749: Deep planting which is highly discouraged
17/04/2025, 21:07 - +254 722 844789: Why is deep planting discouraged?
17/04/2025, 21:12 - +254 722 593749: 1. Waterlogging condition when water settles around the young seedlings slows down root development.
2. Limited access to nutrients since most nutrients are on the upper surface of the soil leading to low yields.
3. The coffee plant takes long to grow rapidly through the vegetative phase.
17/04/2025, 21:14 - +254 722 844789: Thanks.
18/04/2025, 00:35 - +254 713 555529: For Ruiru 11, the tree apoears to be very sweet and attractive to coffee stem borer. With deep planting, the small basin for the borer control is deep down.

18/04/2025, 23:22 - +254 795 220161: WHY MANURE APPLICATION IS IMPORTANT FOR HIGH PRODUCTION IN YOUR COFFEE FARMS.

Why Apply manure/Compost?When should I apply?At what rate should I apply?How to apply. 

Why?
->Adding compost or farmyard manure to your farm helps in addition of Soil organic matter(S.O.M).
->The SOM facilitates soil health through addition of microbial organisms,increasing water and nutrients retention capability.
->Retention capability of the soil for nutrients and water facilitates healthy growth of the plants.
->Healthier plants give high yields and will resist diseases. 

When and rate?
->In coffee farms,apply half a debe during the long and short rains.A total of a debe per year per tree.
->Apply 2weeks after the rains.

How to apply.
->Remove weeds and mulch under the canopy.
->Apply under the canopy leaving 10cm from the stump.Spread.
->Finally ,return the Mulch.

Note:
->Avoid raw manure as it destroys the roots as it decompose.
->If you haven't applied,you can still apply. 
->If you lack manure,use organic fertilzers.

19/04/2025, 12:09 - +254 724 633722: Agroforestry, practiced prudently with the proper spacing is without a doubt, beneficial to coffee. Coffee, from its very origin, is an understory crop.
19/04/2025, 12:11 - +254 722 442781: Give us the scientific benefits of agroforestry that you have observed and can give evidence as far as production is concerned.
19/04/2025, 12:14 - +254 722 442781: I have made the following observation in coffee from  the shaded  trees .
1. They always appear dark green .
2. Flowers less and produce fewer berries than the shaded crop .
If you are not very keen, it is hard to see these differences.
19/04/2025, 12:22 - +254 722 442781: I got curious and toured several farmers in Karatina where Grevillea trees are very common, and I observed that all the crops under these trees appeared weak .
In my own farm.  I planted Sesbania sesban as a border hedge where I was planting French beans in rows parallel to Sesbania hedge . I was shocked to realise that two rows next to the hedge produced less by 60%, and their vigour was wanting .

Sesbania is classified as an agro forestry tree , Grevillea and Calliandra . In all these trees ,I saw a negative effect on crops, which they were hailed to  have a symbiotic relationship.  And that is where I drew my conclusion.  
The sun plays a significant role in photosynthesis, and plants, especially field crops, shouldn't be shaded . 
The trees should be planted along the boundaries.

19/04/2025, 17:12 - +254 722 854576: Let‚Äôs ask ourselves the kind of trees we are talking about.
19/04/2025, 17:32 - +254 724 633722: Shading of between 30 to 40%, achieved with proper spacing, you can get good yields of very good quality. Shade reduces biennial bearing, gives bigger and bolder beans because the cooler temperatures allow for longer maturing and better bean filling. The cup quality is also much better. This is scientifically proven. <This message was edited>
19/04/2025, 18:00 - +254 722 442781: A 30 to 40% reduction in sunlight is significant and could greatly impact photosynthesis. Regarding the quality of coffee, it has been demonstrated that good cup quality can be achieved without shading, indicating that shading may not be a necessary factor for quality. In Brazil and other major coffee-growing countries, shading is not typically advocated.

My primary concern about shading is its potential effects on flowering and the reduced quantity of cherries produced per tree, which I have observed carefully. I would like to challenge those who grow shaded coffee to compare the performance of trees under shade with those that are not shaded, and then we can discuss the findings here.

Additionally, I have analyzed the effects of shading on other crops. I would like to understand more about the biennial effects. Does this mean that the 60 to 70% of trees that are not shaded will be affected by biennial bearing, while the 30 to 40% of shaded trees will not experience these effects?

19/04/2025, 18:52 - +254 775 328606: Trees in coffee reduce yield. It's something anyone can confirm on the farm. Once tree establish themselves it hard to cut them down or trim as coffee is almost bearing through out the year.

19/04/2025, 20:09 - +254 713 555529: The spacing should allow 45 degrees of sunshine. With this rule i planted my Hass avocado shade trees at a spacing of 54 feet alternating. As the avocado tree matures pruning ceatral branches  and those near the trunk brings very moderate sunshine. This forces me the farmer to practice non conventional care to get the fruit clients. This is only pacticable on less than 10 acre holdings because of the massive income from avocado to cater for its care and management.
With ongoing Globdisruptualization, individual farmer has to decide on single or companion planting.
19/04/2025, 20:14 - +254 724 633722: In its native habitat in the Ethiopian forests, coffee grows as an understory plant, where the shade naturally regulates its flowering. However, when grown in full sun, coffee tends to flower excessively. Unlike many orchard crops that manage excess flowering through natural mechanisms like floral or fruit abortion, coffee attempts to mature all its flowers. This results in a biennial bearing cycle: one year, the plant produces an excessive yield, depleting its energy and nutrient reserves and often leading to overbearing dieback. The following year, the plant focuses on recovering its reserves, resulting in little to no yield. Therefore, growing coffee in full sun requires intensive nutrient management to prevent depletion and maintain consistent productivity. In countries like Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia, coffee plantations are typically large-scale, and the trees are routinely uprooted and replanted after a certain period. This contrasts with our context, where coffee plantations often remain productive for over 50 years. In regions such as Ethiopia, India, and countries like Costa Rica, shade management is a common and integral practice in coffee cultivation.
19/04/2025, 20:25 - +254 713 555529: Practically ongoing extremes in weather patters has witnessed coffee bushes stressed by high temperatures. Those with regulated shade are ready to withstand the dryspell.
19/04/2025, 20:31 - +254 720 464900: Now from your research, which trees are these for our region and what is the spacing?
19/04/2025, 20:32 - +254 722 442781: There is a significant difference between a natural habitat, where quantity and quality are not primary considerations, and an artificial environment where coffee is grown for commercial purposes, where both quality and quantity are key performance indicators that determine commercial viability.

In coffee production, where we aim to increase the yield per tree to mitigate against fluctuations in global prices, it is essential that we advise farmers prudently. The biennial nature of coffee production often results from nutrient depletion coupled with insufficient replenishment. Current fertilizer recommendations tend to be blanket approaches that do not take into account the previous year's production, which is necessary for proper compensation.

I would like to challenge agronomists to stop following outdated suggestions without questioning their relevance. It is crucial to adapt our practices based on current knowledge and the specific needs of the coffee plants.
19/04/2025, 20:32 - +254 724 633722: Another significant advantage of shade in coffee cultivation is its ability to mitigate the effects of drought and excessive temperatures by providing a more buffered microclimate. These protective effects are often visually evident, with shaded trees typically exhibiting improved canopy condition and reduced stress symptoms compared to those grown in full sun."
19/04/2025, 20:38 - +254 713 555529: For sure i rest my case.
19/04/2025, 20:40 - +254 722 442781: Let us reason together guys . Extreme weather leads to a loss of moisture from the soil. The larger the tree canopy, the greater the loss of moisture. I am curious how those who advocate for shading seem oblivious to the issue of moisture competition, which can be more detrimental than shading itself. 

We should meet for a cup of coffee to discuss these matters further! üòÖ
19/04/2025, 20:41 - +254 722 442781: Think about moisture competition.
19/04/2025, 20:55 - +254 723 772887: True
19/04/2025, 21:00 - +254 724 633722: Think about it‚Äîeven as a person, wouldn‚Äôt you feel more comfortable sitting under a shade tree than in direct sunlight? Similarly, the temperatures for the coffee is moderated under shade...and when it comes to moisture competition, taller shade trees typically have deeper root systems than coffee plants, which helps reduce competition for water. <This message was edited>
19/04/2025, 21:06 - +254 724 633722: Indeed, we should discuss this issue further, over a steaming cup of "Shade grown coffee"!
19/04/2025, 21:27 - +254 722 442781: This is a very interesting topic. Soil isn't a solid block; it consists of particles with air spaces that can be filled with water after prolonged rainfall, allowing water to infiltrate into the lower zones. Although trees have deep roots, their minor roots and root hairs are primarily concentrated between depths of 1 to 1.5 meters. In this regard, trees do not have the ability to manage moisture in the topsoil and subsoil to avoid competing with coffee plants.

A human being generally feels more comfortable in the shade than in direct sunlight. While humans can obtain vitamin D from brief sun exposure, coffee plants require 11 to 12 hours of sunlight for effective photosynthesis.

Wind exposure can be particularly detrimental, as it increases evapotranspiration (ET) during high temperatures. Therefore, a best practice would be to provide windbreaks by planting trees as border crops.
19/04/2025, 21:31 - +254 722 442781: üòÖThese are indigenous trees .But , whether indigenous  or  not , farmers should plant them in coffee at their own pocket risks.

19/04/2025, 21:39 - +254 722 442781: This and soil analysis should be the basis of formulating coffee fertiliser program..

One disaster in fertiliser recommendation in coffee  is a blanket recommendation of 250g of a certain fertiliser irrespective of the yields from the previous season..
19/04/2025, 23:12 - +254 729 338971: CRI technical materials give clear guidelines on coffee nutrition including calculation based on previous yield. Nutrition should be guided by soil analysis and previous harvest. General recommendations should be used where soil analysis has not been done but should not be the norm. <This message was edited>

*Dangers  in deep planting for  coffee.* 
 _Avoid leaving a basin-like_

While seeming beneficial for stability,deep planting can actually harm the plant and lead to several disadvantages. 
These are inclusive of:
1. Root rot due to waterlogging.This eventually leads to death of plant.
2. Reduced Nutrient and Water Access.
The root system of coffee is in 90cm depth.Deep planting means that roots go down far from where the nutrients are .
3. Growth problems.
Deep planting leads to stunted growth and poor development.
4. Prone to pests and diseases. 
Weak plants makes them susceptible to pests.

 *Note:*
‚óèAvoid deep planting. 
‚óèSeek agronomic advice (@ Denaza agroconsulting we offer this service).
‚óèWe walk with you from land preparation, hole digging , backfilling ,actual planting to management.

24/04/2025, 19:33 - +254 728 831490: Tommorow  after  this lesson kila mkulima  will do practicals on his or her  farm
24/04/2025, 19:33 - +254 728 831490: And give  us the answers here
24/04/2025, 19:33 - +254 728 831490: agreed?
24/04/2025, 19:33 - +254 728 831490: Now this how  you do it according  to size of your  farm
24/04/2025, 19:33 - +254 728 831490: Let's  say 500 trees  you sample  like 10 trees
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: And the trees  you do do in a zigzag way
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Choose  them blindly
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: What  I mean don't  go choosing  may the  ones  that have carried  heavy crop!
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: That's  will  be cooked  outcome üòÅ
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: So go in a zigzag way  your eyes half closed oops
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Now  you are  tree  no 1
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Choose  4 primary  branches
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Branches  A B C and D
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Those  branches  should  be in the 4 directions  of the compass E W N S
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Also the 4 branches  should  be at all levels  of the tree
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Down to top
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Farmers  tuko  pamoja?
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: So branch  A  bottom  of the  tree  direction  E,branch  B middle of the tree  direction  W, branch  C three-quarters  of the tree  direction  N and branch D near top of the tree direction  S
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Then  count berries  in each branch  and record
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Let's  assume  branch  A 130 berries  B 80 berries  C 25 berries  and D 10 berries
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Then  add the berries  of the 4 branches
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Hebu farmers  lets go together  si mfanye hesabu  so that  we move together
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Post the answer
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: After  getting  the answer  we now get the average  of the  4 branches  by total berries  of the 4 branches  divide by 4
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Farmers  I am alone  you are not giving  me the  answers?
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: 61.25
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: 265 berries √∑ 4= 67
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: start  by total berries of the 4
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: So average  of the 4 branches  is 67 berries
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Then  in that tree  count the total bearing  primaries branches
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: Again let us assume 40 primary  branches
24/04/2025, 19:34 - +254 728 831490: So you multiply  the  average  which  was 67 by total  primaries
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: someone give  the  answer
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: 2680
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Thanks  correct
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Then  about 500 berries  makes i kg
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: So how many  kgs in tree  no 1
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: 5.4
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Yes actually  5 .36
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: I had approximated
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: I gave  this  as an example  So you  go trees  2345678910
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: correct
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Again  we assume  this  tree  2 -6 4, 3-4.2 4-2.5 5-7.3, 6-2.2, 7-4.5, 8-8.2, 9- 1.8 and 10 -2.4
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Give the total  kgs of the 10trees
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: someone please add  up
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: including  tree  1 which  was 5.4kgs
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Hey mathematicians?
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Hurry  up so we  conclude almost  crossing the office
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: It's  44.9kgs
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Jameni  are we together  really?
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Then  this total of 10 trees  give  me the average?
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: This  i won't  answer  farmers  kindly  give  me the answer
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: Bedford  can  you try?
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: 4.49kg
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: good
24/04/2025, 19:35 - +254 728 831490: This means  out of the 10 trees  some had high kgs other s had low
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: but now the average  is 4.49 ok? farmers
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: On the block we sampled  we had a total  of 500 trees
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: After  sampling  10 trees  we got total  of 44.9kgs
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: which  gave  us an average  of 4.49 kgs per tree  ok
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Our block  has 500trees  so again  now how many total  kgs in this block of 500 trees?
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Another  farmer  can  you try
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: waiting the answer  just ty
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Ok let me help  its  500 trees  multiply  by the average  of the 10 trees  which  was  4.49
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Now  give me  the answer
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: 500√ó4.49=2245kgs
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: I stand to be corrected
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Thanks  alot you got it right
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: So the farmer  of the block  now knows that  he is likely  to get 2245kgs  of cherry  from  his piece  of land of 500trees
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: But now i now assign farmers  tomorrow  choose  10 trees from  your  farm  do practicals b√®cause mine  was assumptions
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Then  post here  tutakusaidia hesabu
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Again  assuming  the  2245 kgs were real
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: A  coffee  picker can  pick 3 debes  per day and a debe  carries 13 kgs  how many  pickers  will be needed  to pick?
24/04/2025, 19:36 - +254 728 831490: Also assuming price of cherry  is 120 shs per kg this farmer  earned  how  much?
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: Doing this  because  I said  estimation  helps you to plan for pickers and estimated  income
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: 2245kgs
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: (2245√∑39) = 57.5 say 58 pickers
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: 120ksh√ó2245kgs=269,400ksh
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: Thanks for the lesson and the assignment I will do it tomorrow.
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: It's  2245 kgs  √∑13 =172.69 debes
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: 172.69 √∑3=57.56 pickers
24/04/2025, 19:37 - +254 728 831490: good

28/04/2025, 10:29 - +254 713 092858: *Answer:*
At AGRI-BIOTECH FARM INTERNATIONAL (ABFI), the decision to spray nitrogen-based foliars during the rainy season follows a precision farming approach. We base fertilizer and foliar applications on past historical data, soil testing results, pH levels, soil cover status, and nutrient removal estimates from the last yield.
Each coffee harvest removes significant amounts of nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and Boron (B). Therefore, current fertilization must not only correct existing deficiencies but also replenish what was removed during the last crop cycle, and prepare for the current expected yield.

1. Direction (Precision Approach):

Before spraying, conduct a soil test and/or leaf analysis to verify if nitrogen is actually deficient.

Assess last harvest yield: For example, 1 ton of cherry removes around 40‚Äì45 kg N, 7‚Äì9 kg P‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ, and 45‚Äì50 kg K‚ÇÇO, plus minor nutrients like Ca, Mg, and B.

Calculate the nutrient removal and adjust your program.

*Recommended foliar* during rainy seasons: Use a low-nitrogen, high-potassium foliar such as 15-5-30+Ca+Mg+B. This supports fruiting, stem strength, and prevents excess soft vegetative growth.

Spray Timing: Apply early morning or late evening during light rains. Avoid spraying under heavy rainfall or intense sunlight.

2. Direction (Speculative/Variable Factors):
Spraying also depends on:
-Crop Stage: Young trees (vegetative) vs. mature trees (fruiting).
-Tree Age: Younger trees may need more Nitrogen, mature trees need more Potassium and Calcium.
-Altitude and Climate: Higher rainfall and cooler climates increase natural nitrogen availability through atmospheric deposition.

*Rainy Season Effects:* Since rain brings extra nitrogen from the atmosphere, spraying additional high-nitrogen foliars without confirmed deficiency risks creating excessive, weak stem growth that makes the coffee plants vulnerable to disease and lodging.
+ If spraying is necessary:
For young, vegetative trees: apply a balanced foliar like 20-20-20+TE but dilute it by half strength during rainy seasons.
üå≤For mature, fruiting trees: apply a high-potassium foliar like 10-5-35+Ca+B+Zn to strengthen stems, improve cherry size, and enhance quality.

Summary:

> During the rainy season, it is generally not advisable to spray nitrogen-rich foliars unless a deficiency is confirmed through testing or severe visual symptoms are seen. Over-spraying nitrogen can cause soft, weak stems and negatively affect coffee tree structure. Focus instead on strengthening nutrients like Potassium, Calcium, and Boron.

28/04/2025, 10:59 - +254 795 220161: TO DO IN COFFEE BEFORE APRIL ENDS.

You ought to be doing these best agronomic practices in your coffee farms before the month of April 2025 ends.
Be keen not to fail on so doing.

1. De-suckering and maintenance prunning. 
Remove all suckers growing where not needed.
This will ensure the plant feeds well and pests will not find a place to hide.
2. Weeding and mulching. 
Weed to avoid competition for nutrients and mulch to avoid weed growth with the rains.
3. Coffee planting. 
Ensure you have planted the seedlings in the correct way and have the best seedlings.
4. Manure and fertilzer application.
Ensure  you apply manure and fertilzer in your coffee farms.For fertilzer application, you can as well apply in May. Check on the rains if you were late applying. 
5. Crop hygiene. 
Remove all dry berries due to CBD or berry moth to avoid spread.
6. Fungicides for CBD and leafrust.
Ensure you use preventive fungicides for CBD and leaf rust.
If 10% of the affected leaves has leafrust,use a curative fungicides as twiga hypox,tabibu etc.
7. Foliar sprays.
Use foliar feeds with high NPK, with Zinc and boron to aid in berry expansion.

01/05/2025, 06:15 - +254 740 373485: Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, has been experiencing significant challenges in its coffee industry, primarily due to adverse weather conditions, including droughts and extreme heat, which have impacted coffee production and driven up prices. These issues have led to decreased productivity, reduced exports, and higher global coffee prices(Gachagua/munya reform's has nothing to do with the current handsome pays
Here's a more detailed look at what's been happening:
Weather Impacts:
Droughts, extreme heat, and erratic rainfall have severely impacted Brazilian coffee production, leading to decreased yields and damage to coffee plants. 
Decreased Productivity:
In 2024, the average productivity across Brazilian coffee plantations dropped 1.9% from the previous year. 
Reduced Arabica Production:
Rabobank estimates a 13.6% decrease in arabica coffee production in the 2025/26 harvest compared to the previous cycle, while robusta production is estimated to grow. 
Rising Prices:
Global coffee prices have risen due to supply shortages caused by drought in Brazil and other major coffee-producing countries, reports NPR. 
Impact on Exports:
Brazil's coffee exports have been declining due to low stock levels and the impact of the drought. 
Farmers Turning to Irrigation:
Brazilian coffee farmers are increasingly turning to costly irrigation to address the impacts of climate change and drought(should this work, worrying should be our partner Brazil as developed country,they have more than enough manpower and finance to facilitate for the above,the government should ensure that we don't get back to the usual traditional days where coffee farmers were paid in cents).  To maintain this, let's add value to our coffee,by 1) planting new coffee bushes and doing away with the aging 2) get rid of the hardwood trees around our farms 3) maintain soil structure 4) embrace modern ways of coffee farming 5)let youths be in the factory/societal leadership etc,all of this will help us improve on quality, quantity and accountability thus earning more , following up is another activity that the farmer should play part in

05/05/2025, 18:13 - +254 713 092858: The cherry is likely in the berry development stage, following the December‚ÄìJanuary flowering season. At this stage, the berries are small and green, entering the crucial phase of pinhead to early expansion. This is the time when the coffee plant needs the right nutrients to support cell division, berry filling, and overall health. 
   ABFI recommend applying a foliar feed that is rich in Calcium, Potassium, Boron, and Zinc. These nutrients help strengthen the berries, prevent fruit drop, and support uniform growth. Products such as Calcium Nitrate with Boron or high-potassium foliar blends like 13:5:40 + trace elements are ideal. Feeding your coffee correctly now lays the foundation for a strong, profitable harvest.
*Given the rains, we already have Nitrogen from the Rains*

You mean like this?
05/05/2025, 19:50 - +254 740 373485: What are the uses of potassium?
05/05/2025, 20:07 - +254 722 442781: potassium is crucial for the growth and development of coffee plants, influencing both the yield and quality of coffee beans, as well as the flavor profile of the final beverage. Proper management of potassium levels in coffee cultivation is essential for producing high-quality coffee.
05/05/2025, 20:09 - +254 740 373485: Then,do we need it for berry expansion?
05/05/2025, 20:09 - +254 713 092858: Yes
05/05/2025, 20:11 - +254 720 464900: No K here ama?
05/05/2025, 20:13 - +254 713 092858: At the berry development stage, potassium (K) is not only essential for berry filling but also plays a key physiological role in the coffee plant. One of its critical functions is regulating the opening and closing of stomata, which controls water loss and gas exchange. During the rainy season, when humidity is high, potassium ensures proper stomatal function, preventing excessive water loss and supporting steady photosynthesis. It also facilitates the transport of sugars (produced in leaves) to the developing berries, promoting uniform growth and sweetness. Moreover, potassium works in balance with available nitrogen (N)‚Äîwhile nitrogen promotes leaf and vegetative growth, potassium ensures that this energy is effectively redirected toward fruit development. A proper K-N balance prevents excessive leafy growth at the expense of berry quality, leading to healthier plants and a more productive harvest.
05/05/2025, 20:14 - +254 713 092858: Yes

By the way, all nutrients are required all the time during the growing stages. 
The only exception is that some are needed more than the others during different stages .
Preparation before flowering and when the crop is carrying,  nitrogen is required the most ,  flowering, pin head and ripenning,  potassium. 

The fertlizer regime for coffee is designed according to the rainfall pattern. Otherwise, coffee should be fed throughout. 

On Foliars , there is no special time for Foliars, and every month is a foliar month, especially to meet trace elements requirements.  

NB.
NPK are major nutrients required by coffee in 12 months of the year . If any nutrient is deficiency at any single time , yields are compromised.

05/05/2025, 20:33 - +254 713 092858: *mixing different foliars or overdosing the recommended application rate can have serious negative effects on plant health and yield.*  Also different company have different formulation, like gel technology, Nano Technology but to be precise:

1. Phytotoxicity (Plant Burn)
Overapplication or incompatible foliar mixes can cause leaf scorch, curling, or necrosis (dead spots).
This happens because excessive nutrients, especially salts, draw water out of plant cells, damaging leaf tissues.
2. Nutrient Imbalance
Doubling one foliar or mixing incompatible products can create an imbalance‚Äîtoo much of one nutrient (like nitrogen) may block the uptake of others (like calcium or magnesium), affecting overall plant growth and fruit quality.
3. Reduced Absorption
Some nutrients compete for absorption sites on the leaf surface. Mixing them improperly may reduce uptake efficiency, wasting inputs and reducing effectiveness.
4. Chemical Reactions in the Tank
Certain fertilizers or micronutrients (especially those with calcium, phosphorus, or sulfates) can precipitate or react, forming insoluble compounds that clog nozzles or become unavailable to the plant.
5. Crop Stress and Yield Loss
Instead of helping, excessive or poorly mixed foliars stress the plant, reducing flowering, fruit set, or even leading to premature leaf or fruit drop.

1. NPK are similar to main course in a buffet..
2. Calcium, magnesium, and sulphur are like starters desserts, etc, while trace elements are like vegetables and salads .
The way you can't skip the main course in a buffet while hungry is the same way you should value NPK fertilisers ..

NB . Foliars are very expensive means of applying NPK and never be lied to by anyone that you can use foliar as a substitute to basal fertiliser.

Chairman Kahuhia can also confirm how it brought back life to the factories and farmers at large.

Thank you!
15/05/2025, 13:02 - +254 710 591083: Coffee received at wet mill is classified as cherry 1 and 2 before it's processed. After primary processing coffee is delivered to the dry mill for secondary processing. That is when it is graded as AA, AB etc
15/05/2025, 13:20 - +254 722 440732: In Njuriga, when farmers bring their coffee to the factory it's all put in water. What sinks becomes grade A and floaters becomes grade B

15/05/2025, 13:35 - Henry Kinyua: What it does more is to encourage good farmers to continue investing and doing their best since their good grades are not diluted by poor grades from not so serious farmers. 
I have seen it work with several factories, I must be worth the pain for them to continue doing it
15/05/2025, 13:42 - +254 722 721900: Great.  The reason behind it  is sound because grade dilution is the biggest headache in societies. We may need to consult them and sell the idea to our farmers. Paying for their efforts. Nderia 20bob <This message was edited>

In the current 2024/2025 season, the county and its two affiliated cooperatives, Chepkube (XDA 004) and Kimama (XDA 039), have shown remarkable quality improvements compared to the 2023/2024 season.

However, classification is not important, we sold good quality coffee, and we were paid good money,.

Farmer's at Njuriga bring their coffee to the factory, deep it in water,,.... All that remains on bottom is classified as A and what's floating is classified as B, other classification you mentioned here are beyond us.

The method deeping coffee in water, lazy farmers don't like it. ü§£

Some grades quantities are too small for classification and may create a lot of confusion to the farmers. It may also create loopholes for embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. All farmers contribute to each grade and hence the need for equitable apportionment of the revenue.
17/05/2025, 14:36 - +254 725 477877: Mashamba yetu ni kidogo, na sio wote wa napenda kulima kahawa, so are few farmers taking our coffee there. And every year the production is increasing. Note. üòú

19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: Hello  farmers  i have  been  requested to  talk  about  cherry  and Mbuni
19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: 4-5kgs of cherry  is 1 kg of Mbuni  then  5-6kgs of cherry  is equals to 1kg parchment
19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: If you dry good  cherry  into  Mbuni  you loose
19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: Let's  say this if 1 kg of cherry  is paid at 130 that means  5kgs is 650 shs
19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: But if you check  current  prices  of Mbuni  is probably  340 shs
19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: So doing Mbuni you  loose  310shs
19/05/2025, 15:25 - +254 728 831490: This means  you can  not argue 1kg of Mbuni  is better  paid than 1kg of cherry
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: Pardon
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: <Media omitted>
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: For training  about  cherry and Mbuni  i would  like to use  this as an example
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: This society  paid cherry  at 120shs and Mbuni  at 256shs
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: So  as I said 5 kgs of cherry  will give  1kg Mbuni
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: So 5 kgs of cherry  here will  be 600shs
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: This means cherry fetch more than mbuni
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: But if you dry  the same 5 kgs of cherry  to get 1 kg of Mbuni  you  get paid 256 shs
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: So you loose  600 -256=344shs
19/05/2025, 16:29 - +254 728 831490: Farmers  are you getting  me?
19/05/2025, 17:29 - +254 722 338131: When you dry good cherry to mbuni like, it's called natural and the offers are good. Not bought at mbuni price.

To my knowledge.
19/05/2025, 17:43 - +254 724 569697: Whats thr price for naturals?
19/05/2025, 17:50 - Henry Kinyua: <Media omitted>
Naturals are NH and NL as you $266 and $227 per bag respectively. 
But you can also see some NH fetched a high price of $521 per bag. 
There are different ways of processing Naturals and best way is to be intentional and try to where possible let potential buyers know you will be producing Naturals‚Ä¶way before you take it to the market
19/05/2025, 17:53 - +254 727 140450: Some Naturals fetched up to $60  per kg at the private Auction held at Safari Park last February
19/05/2025, 17:56 - +254 722 238968: What are those you're calling naturals
19/05/2025, 18:05 - +254 722 860655: In fact I thought the farmer who was preferring to convert Cherries into Mbuni for a perceived better price was actually converting the cherries into naturals.
19/05/2025, 18:06 - +254 722 860655: ‚Ä¶.and not mbuni per se. <This message was edited>
19/05/2025, 18:11 - +254 720 464900: This good cherry that is dried instead of taking it through wet washing and fermentation. Note good cherry and the process itself has to be very meticulous to avoid fermentation on the drying tables... they call it natural processing... <This message was edited>

19/05/2025, 21:46 - +254 722 762945: As a farmer, please process naturals only when you know you have a market for it , otherwise it might go into Mbuni category and you‚Äôll lose out .
20/05/2025, 11:15 - +254 722 338131: Great advice!

21/05/2025, 19:09 - +254 722 442781: This can be a very interesting debate . There are possibly two types of mbuni .
1.  Mbuni from muhururo, which might be in different sizes of maturity , shrivelled berries, etc .
2. Mature cherry picked and dried ..
If you pick 1t of cherry, pulp it ,dry, and follow all processes,  the average expected clean coffee be  650kgs .

If you decide to dry the 1t  as mbuni 2 and then mill , the expected clean coffee will be 650kgs .

26/05/2025, 20:15 - +254 701 641933: The squash bug is a sap-sucking insect which belongs to the Coreidae family. Coreidae are called twig-wilters or tip-wilters because they mostly feed on young twigs, injecting juices that macerate the tissues of the growing tips and cause them to wilt abruptly.
26/05/2025, 20:33 - +254 727 313906: Too technical! Talk to farmers who never went to a biology class.

27/05/2025, 10:03 - +254 711 138280: This is well said.
27/05/2025, 10:07 - +254 722 338131: Ordinary pool/bathroom tiles.

The whole essence is cleanliness and ensure no stinkers. Get a qualified fundi because the corners have to be in perfect fit.

Finally ensure staff are well sensitised on their safety because of the slippery nature of the floor especially with mucilage. Buy for them 'industrial' heavy gumboots for entry.

Hope it helps!

01/06/2025, 18:08 - +254 720 464900: Thot it is about mites
01/06/2025, 18:20 - +254 722 593749: Just scout then I shall give You a remedy
01/06/2025, 18:51 - +254 727 863638: Sir, it may have been better if you were to briefly describe what to look for. He might not even have an idea of how the mites look like!!

02/06/2025, 09:02 - +254 740 373485: These are tea mites,they attack throughout the season....after attacking the leaves have a "sun like burn ' and turns black . . unlike thrips,tea mites attack the new shoots only
02/06/2025, 09:08 - +254 722 690792: Am adviced by many..it is zinc boron deficiency by some agrmnmist.am told is thrips attack ..

02/06/2025, 09:11 - +254 740 373485: First that's a mites attack, thrips will leave your leaves and berries curled and decolourised,and will only attack on a dry season....if so as they say is a zinc /,boron deficiency then why only affect the new shoots and leave them scorched?
02/06/2025, 09:12 - +254 722 690792: Spray insecticide combined with thiovit jet
02/06/2025, 09:13 - +254 740 373485: Get any sulphur based fungicides and spray,a week later spray a tank mix of zinc and foliar
02/06/2025, 09:13 - +254 722 690792: Am adviced by one to do this..I remember having this problem sometimes back..I used thiovit .it did wonders
02/06/2025, 09:17 - +254 740 373485: It's a sulphur based fungicide,don't tank mix it... also at osho they have wetsulf
02/06/2025, 09:20 - +254 722 690792: Am doing Insectcide tomrw thiovit on Friday.
I had done green cooper on Friday last
02/06/2025, 09:22 - +254 740 373485: If you'd done copper based fungicide I guess it'd have been advisable of you to tank mix with insecticides, they are compatible....for sulphur based fungicide,wait for 14 days to do it(do not mix sulphur based fungicide with any other products apart from stickers)
02/06/2025, 09:25 - +254 722 690792: I respect your observation but the agrmnmist who adviced me  even last time I had the problem has vast experience...works for a leading producer society in kirinyaga
02/06/2025, 09:25 - +254 740 373485: Meaning?
02/06/2025, 09:31 - +254 722 690792: Am having varied advice which give me more experiences
02/06/2025, 09:32 - +254 740 373485: Refer to the above
03/06/2025, 06:58 - +254 701 641933: This is leaves crinkling causes by hot and cold weather, mainly affect trees which are open to immediate hot temperatures most farmer mistakes this with lack of zinc and boron but are different from that deficiency
03/06/2025, 07:01 - +254 701 641933: IMG-20250603-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
For zinc they are niddle like and small for boron they curve with black margins on one side they don't crinkle

Good afternoon friends. I need help with this disease, it is worrying
03/06/2025, 13:17 - +254 722 593749: It looks like Fusarium Wilt or Coffee Wilt Disease....kindly check purplish colour on the stems and constructed neck like structures at the base of suckers where suckers join the trunk or main stems. Uproot and discard the affected bush. Leave the hole for a period not less than 6 months before replacing. Ensure to thoroughly treat the hole
03/06/2025, 13:19 - +254 722 721900: While at it, can coffee pulp spread the fusarium when used as manure on coffee farms?
03/06/2025, 13:33 - +254 722 593749: True. Especially if applied before completely decomposing
03/06/2025, 13:34 - +254 722 721900: Asante
03/06/2025, 15:15 - +254 722 759110: Thank you @Jay 
There are quite a number affected, where would this infection have come from
03/06/2025, 15:20 - +254 722 593749: Welcome. This disease is really destructive and can wipe out an entire coffee farm. It's a soil borne fungus. Do You dig Your coffee farm?
03/06/2025, 15:25 - +254 722 759110: We first slash the weeds and then scrape the top with a jembe
03/06/2025, 15:29 - +254 722 593749: Okay digging spreads it. Also consider sterilizing pruning saw and secateurs after working on one coffee tree before working on the next. Infected tools spread it as well. Kindly uproot all affected trees.
03/06/2025, 15:36 - +254 722 759110: @Jay 
Thanks 
So much of work & resources has been expended to try salvage the farm. I guess we‚Äôll be forced to bite the bullet
03/06/2025, 16:01 - +254 722 721900: You should also consider engaging the CRI for some soil etc analysis ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

03/06/2025, 16:45 - +254 722 593749: Yes. Pathological tests. The most challenging part is how to clear the fungus in the soil once detected.
03/06/2025, 17:17 - +254 722 759110: Do i need to rid 2000+ coffee bushes?
03/06/2025, 18:08 - +254 722 593749: No. Get an expert to visit the farm before making any decision. The disease can be managed through conditioning of soil through application and drenching around the root zone using root guard and marshal. Good nutrition also makes the severity reduce. As You do this plan to gradually and systematically uproot and replace

04/06/2025, 20:04 - +254 713 092858: For proper solutions, always considered physical farm inspection. This removes a lot of "if" and guess works..
04/06/2025, 20:07 - +254 713 092858: Additionally, we advise farmers to have records on yearly production activities and challenges so that challenges can be anticipated earlier. Most diseases and pests are discovered when damage is visible and times spraying does not immediately solve the issue..with data, farmers can be able to track and know what to expect

What is this weed
07/06/2025, 10:01 - +254 740 373485: I tend to understand that you are asking "after spraying foliar fertilizer,how many days should I take to do a copper based fungicide,,/fungicide".... The answer is "not less than seven day's"
07/06/2025, 10:01 - +254 740 373485: And it's always advisable to start with foliar then copper/fungicide
07/06/2025, 10:02 - +254 740 373485: These are tea mite infestation (in the category of sucking mites). ..use sulphur based fungicide to eradicate them,then spray zinc to rejuvenate the new shoots
07/06/2025, 10:04 - +254 722 238968: Thanks a bunch, in deed am spraying foliar right now and fungicide is due for spraying on 17th, its only that I have detected some young berries falling on the ground from SL plants
07/06/2025, 10:06 - +254 722 238968: More advice is most welcome
07/06/2025, 10:07 - +254 722 238968: <Media omitted>
This is the problem I have witnessed
07/06/2025, 10:08 - +254 740 373485: Then in this case,you should do with priorities,if berries are falling, identify the cause....can either be fungal infection, pesticide's attack or abortion
07/06/2025, 10:09 - +254 740 373485: This is serious and it's asking of you to introduce curative fungicide....it's better if you start with fungicide
07/06/2025, 10:10 - +254 722 238968: How do I rule out what to know what to deal with
07/06/2025, 10:21 - +254 722 238968: Unfortunately as we chat am doing foliar, hence going by your advice I have to wait for 7 days to do the fungicid
07/06/2025, 10:21 - +254 722 238968: While at that which fungicide would you recommend
07/06/2025, 10:28 - +254 722 807906: Please give examples of sulphur based fungicides.
07/06/2025, 10:59 - +254 740 373485: We've wetsulf from osho(I've used this and I can attest and recommend it)
07/06/2025, 11:03 - +254 740 373485: Curative fungicides contain active ingredients that can eradicate existing fungal infections after they have already been established on a plant. Some common examples include tebuconazole, ciproconazole, azoxystrobin, and others.¬†
Key Active Ingredients in Curative Fungicides:
Tebuconazole:

07/06/2025, 11:50 - +254 722 721900: Those societies under certification by Rain forest and Fairtrade which insecticides are you using?
07/06/2025, 12:04 - +254 722 807906: Please give examples of brands one can ask from an agrochemist.
07/06/2025, 15:47 - +254 714 174169: Quadris, Cabrio,  Delan
07/06/2025, 15:48 - +254 714 174169: Others are Thiovit and Microthiol
07/06/2025, 18:41 - +254 720 698206: All said and done,we are just common farmers, please give a list of trade name for those curatives, our agrivets don't understand the technical jargon üôÑ
08/06/2025, 09:11 - +254 740 373485: Ok, it'd be much notable that ain't in anyway here to brand either of the agro chemicals company BT I've been using osho products throughout the season,this is the third year am in to it,the reason is their products availability as well as workability 
1)oshothane
2)token
3) control 
4)shadow
5) pearl .....                                                                        I have used some of them and one may arguably engage me and say that they have not been generally manufactured for coffee,BT CBD is a fungal infection and as far as my coffee farming knowledge is concerned I prefer to use products manufactured for sensitive plants like horticulture.....their concentration are higher and works immediately,a product like pearl has carbedanzim at 500g/l and it cures immediately (I've used and can attest to it).... anytime I'm purchasing for a product, I'll always concentrate on it's active ingredient, concentration and purpose
08/06/2025, 09:15 - +254 727 140450: Mancozeb in coffee???
08/06/2025, 09:17 - +254 740 373485: For leaf rust

08/06/2025, 13:17 - +254 740 373485: Like said,I've  tried them in my farm and can give my testimony....it's not about what is approved by what's working for my farm.
08/06/2025, 13:19 - Henry Kinyua: That is a very dangerous view since you are not just producing for your personal consumption. If the product is not approved either on or off label using it is endangering consumers health and can destroy the market. Product approval is for a very specific purpose.
08/06/2025, 13:21 - +254 740 373485: I stand to be corrected,it wasn't a recommendation but an insight

As we dismiss these regulations on recommended pesticide, just know that when produce from Kenya is randomly tested and found unfit for human consumption or with high levels of chemicals, *all we farmers will face the ban*, whether we have complied or not, the ban can easily be national.

Remember in 2010 when EU banned all fresh produce from Kenya for the same reasons. Ilipata wasiokuwemo na waliokuwemo.

16/06/2025, 12:22 - kimuri: A women-led coffee farming initiative launched by Nandi Woman Representative Cynthia Muge is transforming the livelihoods of thousands of rural women across the county.

The project, dubbed ‚ÄòKahawa na Mama‚Äô, aims to rejuvenate the region‚Äôs coffee sector while empowering women to attain financial independence. Rolled out shortly after the 2022 general elections, the programme is built on four key pillars: women‚Äôs economic empowerment, agricultural revival, grassroots self-reliance, and environmental sustainability.

I see so many brands being sold in the market and is said to be good for coffee. For example: is 23:23:0 ok for use as compound fertilizer instead of the ones containing all the three elements? Such as
20:10:10
17:17:17
22:6:12

21/06/2025, 20:35 - +254 721 957094: Yes it's happening... seen it in at least 3 farms
21/06/2025, 20:35 - +254 721 957094: On Both ruiru and grafted
21/06/2025, 20:45 - +254 724 569697: Isnt Ruiru 11 resistant ti cbd?
21/06/2025, 20:46 - +254 722 442781: Ruiru 11 can lose its resistance to Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) if a farmer raises seedlings from seeds harvested from Ruiru 11 plants that were not planted in isolation. In such cases, cross-pollination with susceptible varieties, such as SL, may occur, which could weaken the resistance of Ruiru 11 to CBD.
21/06/2025, 20:50 - +254 722 721900: Thanks
21/06/2025, 21:00 - +254 724 569697: Thought Ruiru11 seeds are prepared differently!!!? Not from seeds of directly frim other Ruiru11 plants ? Isnt it why its is expensive? ? 
Why wouldnt CRI supply such seeds knowing the risks involved?
22/06/2025, 08:47 - +254 710 591083: Ruiru 11 is a hybrid produced through artificial insemination. You cannot harvest seed from these plants for propagation. If you do that the resulting plants will be a segregated population and it's not R11. That is why it's only CRI that supply the seeds.
22/06/2025, 09:03 - +254 722 721900: So I treat it as SL and struggle with cbd for now as I ponder whether to replant, graft etcü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
22/06/2025, 09:09 - +254 710 591083: Consider top working with certified R11 scions.
22/06/2025, 09:10 - +254 722 690792: Sometimes science in crops confuse,am doing this type of ruiru and wonders

22/06/2025, 09:10 - +254 722 690792: IMG-20250622-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
22/06/2025, 09:25 - +254 717 133790: For now as you consider maybe top working or planting a new, you can strip off all the affected berries then spray green copper or kilifos. They are quite mild compared to other CBD fungicides but they would help with protecting the remaining berries. Make sure to spray all the berries properly so that they are totally covered by the fungicide. Using a sticker could help. <This message was edited>
22/06/2025, 09:33 - +254 722 721900: You mean On ruiru?
22/06/2025, 09:37 - +254 710 591083: What this farmer described is not R11.
22/06/2025, 09:38 - +254 710 591083: It's a segregated population
22/06/2025, 09:38 - +254 722 721900: Mine is ruiru 11 with that challenge, which I have had for some time now
22/06/2025, 09:38 - +254 775 328606: Pls send me Conduct of buying Ruiru 11 seeds.
22/06/2025, 09:40 - +254 722 442781: I would advise that you do so .
And if you were to buy grafted Ruiru , please be keen to establish the source of the ruiru scions .
22/06/2025, 09:47 - +254 722 442781: Artificial insemination or Pollination?
22/06/2025, 09:51 - +254 724 569697: Thats exactly what i thought. So then whoever says CBD disease on those ruiru 11 plants is not true?
Kindly enlighten us. Can CBD affect Ruiru 11 plants?
22/06/2025, 09:52 - +254 724 569697: @ Cecilia Gathurima, could you respond to this?
22/06/2025, 09:54 - +254 724 569697: If CBD affects Ruiru11 then there is no diff. with SL
22/06/2025, 10:00 - +254 722 442781: In Kenya, it is crucial to ensure that Ruiru 11 seeds for propagation are sourced exclusively from the Coffee Research Institute (CRI). Ruiru 11 is a hybrid developed by CRI, and the specific parentage and breeding process are proprietary to the institute. This means that any seeds obtained from Ruiru 11 trees, whether from a nursery operator's own farm or from neighboring farms, cannot replicate the original hybrid characteristics of Ruiru 11.

While the seeds from CRI may be priced at approximately 3000 KES per kilogram or more, this cost reflects the research and development that has gone into creating a high-quality hybrid that offers desirable traits such as disease resistance and high yield. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous nursery operators may attempt to cut costs by mixing CRI-purchased seeds with seeds sourced from their own Ruiru 11 trees or from other local sources. This practice not only undermines the integrity of the hybrid but also poses risks to the quality and performance of the coffee plants produced.

It is essential for nursery operators to adhere to ethical practices and obtain seeds solely from CRI to ensure that they are providing genuine Ruiru 11 seedlings. This will help maintain the quality and reliability of the coffee produced, ultimately benefiting both the growers and the industry as a whole.
22/06/2025, 10:19 - +254 722 721900: You are absolutely right.   I recently attended a training at CRI and now know that even the grafting we have been doing is wanting.  We source scions from everywhere, yet it should be strictly from a clonal garden.  How many people offering these services know this ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
22/06/2025, 11:20 - +254 722 721900: @145586674229496  might you be having the current training brochure for coffee management, nursery and factory managers courses?
22/06/2025, 15:51 - +254 722 238968: What about Zions cut from R≈´ir≈´ 11 and grafted with SL
22/06/2025, 15:54 - +254 722 442781: Preferably, you confirm that the Ruiru 11 is original , you will be OK.
22/06/2025, 15:56 - +254 722 238968: Thanks you almost scared me out of my bones
22/06/2025, 15:57 - +254 722 721900: Get from a clonal garden established for that purpose
22/06/2025, 16:01 - +254 722 442781: One issue that might be controversial here üòÖ is that you don't get any advantage by grafting ruiru scion to SL, and you can simply graft  Ruiru on Ruiru , Batian or SL .

People talk about SL having a  deeper  root system, and  the root of a plant is also influenced by the canopy of the same plant .

An SL plant develops a bigger root system because of carrying a heavier canopy . But when SL rootstock carries a Ruiru scion , its root system will be as deeper as dictated by the canopy ..
22/06/2025, 16:04 - +254 722 442781: There is no difference between obtaining scions from  a clonal garden and those from a confirmed Ruiru plantation that was initiated from the original seed from CRI ..
22/06/2025, 16:09 - +254 722 721900: Ok Thought that the clonal garden seedlings undergo a second stage of testing resistance
22/06/2025, 16:36 - +254 722 442781: Yes, they do. But ,as a rule of thumb  when selecting for scions,  the key aspect is always to select  from trees with the desired characteristics, in this case, resistance to CBD and high yielding . This happens in a clonal garden or from an existing field.  The problem is that most nursery operators are entrepreneurs than professionals, and profit is the key motivating factor ..

For example @165944768888835 , I am sure it is not all the ruiru trees that are being affected by CBD , right ? 
Those that are not being affected and are high yielding are very good candidates for scion harvesting..
22/06/2025, 16:38 - +254 722 721900: ‚òëÔ∏è agreed.  We are working on isolating them
22/06/2025, 16:38 - +254 740 373485: Here's where Resistance and Tolerance comes in.They are two difference
22/06/2025, 16:38 - +254 722 442781: What's the difference?
22/06/2025, 16:51 - +254 724 569697: Resist:: stay away from
Tolerate:: stay with it but dont die from itü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, yaani survive from itü§≠ <This message was edited>
22/06/2025, 16:56 - +254 722 442781: Yaani resistance is 95%, no CBD .
Tolerance may be 75%, which won't be affected by CBD . 
Not factual, though üòÖ

Wako wapi Plant pathologists ?
22/06/2025, 16:56 - +254 740 373485: Resistance means that a certain variety has an ability to prevent a disease (in this case fungal CBD) establishing itself while tolerance means a plant has an ability to withstand the negative effects of a disease without significant yield loss .... Resistant plants avoid infections while tolerant plants can cope with infection BT due to human activities over time,we've turned the resistance varieties into tolerant ones, environmental change as well
22/06/2025, 17:01 - +254 722 442781: Let me give an example in Horticulture..Sometimes ago there was a variety of fine beans called Teresa, which was resistant to Rust . No sprays were done against rust, and it became very popular.  But within a period of 7 years , Teresa beans lost their ability to resist the rust pathogens . Probably through pathogens mutation or malpractice by the breeder .
22/06/2025, 17:03 - +254 740 373485: Last weekend I visited a Ruiru 11 and Batian farmer in Kamacharia who has a big portion of land,i noted that in some parts both R√ªir√ª and CBD he has several cases of CBD while the other has no single case of the above...I got curious and asked him why two cases.... here's what he said       "I introduced cooper to the part that you've seen cases of CBD,BT on the portion you didn't see any case,I've never sprayed copper since establishment",                   knowing that copper has minerals essential for a plant that  are only found in copper,I asked him  "how do you source the said minerals", this time he didn't have an answer by said "I do make sure I've proper feeding than risking my berries to CBD/LR in the name of 'extra minerals ' "

Since they know we are insisting on farmers to read the product labels, they are now fraudulently including coffee on labels of products that have not been registered for use in coffee. This shows how determined they are to swindle your hard earned cash. To beat them ensure the product you buy is *listed in the CRI list *or confirm that coffee is listed under its uses in the pcpb website.

24/06/2025, 20:01 - +254 722 593749: This is Coffee Leaf Rust. When applying fungicides....make sure that the pressure in the knapsack is so high such that the spray is atomised into fine droplets that appear as mist and ensure that there's thorough coverage on the lower epidermis or underside of the leaves. Kindly supervise your spray team.
Also consider using other approaches such as:
1. Good nutrition program that's well balanced and avoid overusing highly Nitrogenous fertilizers.... 
2. Proper canopy management so that leaves can dry quickly due to improved air circulation and enough light penetration.
3. Consider varietal conversion (top working) with resistant or tolerant varieties.
4. GAP's such as mulching, weed control and shade management also help a great deal.
NB: scout Your farm regularly or frequently and if in every tree you scout 10 or more leaves are affected then spring into action.
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WITH MOST COFFEE FARMERS IS OVER RELIANCE ON PESTICIDES TO ADDRESS PEST & DISEASE CHALLENGES IN THE FARM.

25/07/2025, 11:30 - +254 735 819129: This is the most heart breaking calamity in crop production especially in coffee. It's happened to me and I've started preparation for the next bearing season. Having some idea for coffee but nothing for avocados
25/07/2025, 11:45 - +254 723 844860: *Abscission* in plants is the process where plant parts like leaves, flowers, or fruits detach from the parent plant. This natural process is regulated by both environmental factors and internal signals like aging and stress. It's a way for plants to shed unwanted or damaged parts, manage resources, and aid in seed dispersal. 
 *Here's a more detailed explanation:* 
 *What is abscission* ?
 *Abscission* is the shedding of plant parts. It's a specific process that occurs at a specialized zone called the abscission zone. This zone is a layer of cells at the base of the plant part where separation will eventually occur. 
 *Why does it happen* ?
1. *Natural Aging* :
Leaves, petals, and fruits eventually age and become less functional. Abscission allows the plant to remove these senescing parts. 
2 *. Environmental Stress:* 
Factors like drought, extreme temperatures, or nutrient deficiencies can trigger abscission. 
Resource Management:
By shedding leaves in the fall, plants reduce water loss during winter and conserve resources. 
 *3.Seed Dispersal* :
Fruits abscise from the plant, aiding in seed dispersal by animals or wind. 
 *How does it happen* ?
The process involves several steps:
‚Ä¢ *Cellular changes:* Specific cells in the abscission zone undergo changes. The middle lamella (the layer between cells) weakens. 
‚Ä¢ *Hormonal Control* : Hormones like ethylene promote abscission, while auxin can delay it. 
‚Ä¢ *Protective layer formation* : Before the part detaches, a protective layer forms on the plant side of the abscission zone, sealing the wound. 
‚Ä¢ *Detachment* : Finally, the plant part detaches from the main plant. 
 *Examples of abscission* :
1. *Leaf abscission* : The shedding of leaves in the fall by deciduous trees.
2. *Petal abscission* : The dropping of petals after flowering.
3. *Fruit abscission* : The shedding of immature fruits (fruit drop).
4. *Flower abscission* : The shedding of entire flowers.
25/07/2025, 11:48 - +254 723 844860: Use BIOSTIMULANT such as BOOT V to help manage the stress

03/08/2025, 11:52 - +254 714 174169: 1. Change cycle after every 5 to 6 production years.
2. Prune well to reduce microclimate.
3. If it is SL, follow *spray program*, which starts shortly before onset of rains using copper. From coffee expansion stage maintain 14 days interval  on heavy rain, 21 days on moderately high rains and 28 days on normal rains. Do not spray systemic(e.g, Cabrio, Quadris)fungicides back to back, nor do more than 3 in a cropping season. If you do systemic plus copper in round 1, do a translaminar (e.g., Delan) plus copper in round 2

With a deep understanding that spans from farm practices to final packaging, Kamau is emerging as a powerful force in coffee value addition, a segment still largely unexplored by many young people in the country.

05/08/2025, 07:55 - +254 722 279183: Good initiative, but how does John buy green coffee beans from youth and women led groups?
05/08/2025, 09:32 - +254 728 793980: Good question
05/08/2025, 09:53 - +254 722 338131: I may not answer for John but yes it's possible to separate coffee at the factory. I witnessed a coffee program in Nandi where the key goal was to increase women participation in the coffee value chain at leadership, production as workers levels in the coop. Male who championed the initiative in the program gave their wives afew coffee trees like 50 stems this allowing the women to be share holders thus giving voting rights during AGM's. The women were trained on GAP's to increase production per tree. The coop allowed women to bring coffee on certain days of the week and was tended separately up to sales. The success of the program was that that there was a specic buyer for the women coffee and bought at premium prices attracting more men to participate in the program. The very interesting bit was that the household incomes increased and the men consciously sold even what was their through their wife's MNO with the goal to increase family income. I believe the youths were enjoined with the women to encourage them since there was no particular buyer for youth coffee then. These initiatives have increased coffee production in both Kericho and Nandi counties.

Hope it helps abit before you get to know exactly where John's program is in supporting the women and the youth.
