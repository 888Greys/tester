Coffee Farming Best Practices Guide

Coffee Plant Varieties:
- Arabica: High quality beans, grown at higher altitudes (1000-2000m)
- Robusta: More resistant to disease, higher caffeine content
- SL28 and SL34: Popular varieties in Kenya, developed for high quality cup profile

Planting and Growing:
1. Site Selection:
   - Altitude: 1000-2000 meters above sea level
   - Rainfall: 1200-2000mm per year
   - Temperature: 15-24Â°C
   - Well-drained, fertile soil with pH 6.0-6.5

2. Land Preparation:
   - Clear the land and remove weeds
   - Dig planting holes 60cm x 60cm x 60cm
   - Apply compost or well-decomposed manure

3. Planting:
   - Plant during the rainy season
   - Space plants 2.5m x 2.5m (1600 plants per hectare)
   - Plant seedlings at 18 months old

Disease Management:
1. Coffee Berry Disease (CBD):
   - Symptoms: Dark spots on berries and leaves
   - Prevention: Regular pruning, copper-based fungicides
   - Treatment: Apply recommended fungicides during flowering

2. Coffee Leaf Rust:
   - Symptoms: Orange-yellow spots on leaves
   - Prevention: Plant resistant varieties, proper spacing for air circulation
   - Treatment: Copper-based fungicides

3. Coffee Wilt Disease:
   - Symptoms: Wilting and death of branches
   - Prevention: Use certified disease-free seedlings
   - Treatment: Remove and burn infected plants

Harvesting:
1. Timing:
   - Main harvest: October to February in Kenya
   - Pick only ripe, red berries
   - Selective picking improves quality

2. Processing:
   - Wet processing: Fermentation for 12-36 hours
   - Dry processing: Sun-drying for 2-3 weeks
   - Proper drying to 11-12% moisture content

Pest Control:
1. Coffee Berry Borer:
   - Small holes in coffee berries
   - Use pheromone traps
   - Cultural practices: clean harvesting, proper storage

2. Antestia Bug:
   - Causes potato taste defect
   - Regular scouting and monitoring
   - Biological control methods

Quality Improvement:
1. Post-harvest handling:
   - Clean processing equipment
   - Proper fermentation timing
   - Uniform drying on raised beds

2. Storage:
   - Store in clean, dry conditions
   - Use jute bags or grain pro bags
   - Avoid contamination with foreign odors

Soil Management:
1. Fertilizer Application:
   - NPK fertilizer: 250-300kg per hectare
   - Apply in two splits during rainy seasons
   - Organic matter: 2-3 kg per plant annually

2. Mulching:
   - Use coffee pulp, grass, or crop residues
   - Apply 5-10cm thick layer around plants
   - Helps retain moisture and suppress weeds

Pruning:
1. Formative Pruning:
   - Remove suckers and water shoots
   - Maintain 2-3 main stems per plant
   - Start pruning at 2 years

2. Production Pruning:
   - Remove old, unproductive branches
   - Maintain good canopy structure
   - Prune after harvest season

Financial Management:
1. Record Keeping:
   - Track input costs and revenues
   - Monitor yield per plant/hectare
   - Calculate cost of production

2. Marketing:
   - Direct sales to cooperatives
   - Quality premium for grade AA
   - Consider specialty markets for higher prices
